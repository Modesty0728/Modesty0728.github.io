        <p>Even until today, the night of April 14, 1912, the sunk of the Titanic is still an anguishing catastrophe that not only people around the world mourn, but also sung as a dirge in deluge of literature. In Thomas Hardy’s poem, The Convergence of the Twain, the readers dive into old memories and realize the authentic reason for this tragedy, which is the arrangement of the Destiny and God, instead of human vanity and fragility by the help of diction, syntax, and figurative language.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the excerpt, Milan Kundera uses juxtaposition of “dolce vita” and “risky return” to boost the suspense of the ultimate choice that “he chose”, which is adroitly involved in a periotic sentence that emphasizes his shocking decision–”the return”. This resolution is further underlined by the following two parallel sentences with relatable conspicuous contrasts followed by the anaphora of “Rather than”, altogether not only creating a sense of consistency and fluency that is easier to read, but also impressing the readers with memorable rhythm and symmetrical pattern.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The author uses literacy devices like diction and imagery to establish a mutually corresponding and aggravating  relationship between the setting and the protagonist, Raskolnikov, in the excerpt from <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. The chaotic but vivid imageries are depicted from the view of Raskolnikov. This implies that it is himself that chooses to see “scaffolding” “lime and brick and dust everywhere”, smell “the intolerable stench of the saloons” under this certain circumstance and atmosphere. What Raskolnikov subconsciously sees are completely agitating, which reflects and also aggravates “the deepest loathing” deep down, prompted by the disgusting setting.</p>
<p>What I think is a good example for me to learn from:</p>
<p>“With vivid and unique selection of details and diction to set up agitating, poignant tactile and olfactory imagery, Dostoevsky creates a realistic setting for the opening of his novel, the torrid, fetid, and chaotic summer day in St. Petersburg, which not only conspicuously mirrors the protagonist’s unquenchable agitation and misanthropic inclination that are aggravated even more by the repulsive setting incubated by the author’s elaborate selection of words, but also implies the further chaos and struggle in the story that the protagonist would have to encounter. For an extremely agitated person like the Raskolnikov, the summer in St. Peterburg is not just “hot” but “ferocious”, and what he smells from the street and the saloons is not just “smell” but “intolerable stench”. Both of the tactile and olfactory imagery created by the synchronization of diction with strong negative connotation creates the sense of chaos and agitation, stimulating not just “dissatisfaction” but “the deepest loathing” from the protagonist’s face, and “jarred instantly and unpleasantly” on his already unappeasably intense nerves, foreshadowing his upcoming inevitable mental explosion. The sensory imagery and the descriptive psychological portrayal of the protagonist adroitly created by the author’s careful selection of words are relatable to most readers, who share a common understanding about the inseparable relation between one’s mental state and one’s perception of the environment. Therefore, readers can feel clearly that it is Raskolnikov’s mental pandemonium that leads him to see, feel, and most importantly, be tormented by the chaos  in reality, and in the meantime, it is the chaos in the reality that elevate his mental pandemonium to an irrevocable level.</p>

        <p>Through adroit and subtle manipulation of narrative pace and sequence (paragraph idea), Trumbo strengthens the characterization of the father and the son and in the mean time reinforces the excerpt’s theme about their mutual love and considerateness (reflect thesis). In the third paragraph, in a simple, smooth dialogue without quotation marks, colons, or similar punctuation, marked by austere and simple syntactical pattern (narrative pace-evidence), Trumbo intentionally accelerates his narrative pace in order to demonstrate the boy wanted to accelerate his conversation with his father and therefore attenuate his choice about choosing Bill Harper. The accelerating dialogue implies the boy’s strong intention to not to hurt his father’s feeling, which shows his considerateness and maturity that is not so common in teenage boys.</p>
<p>Hook:</p>
<p>Growing up, cutting off reliance on parents and family, and finding new environment, companies, as well as lifestyle for adulthood is a natural and inevitable phase of life that any teenager must encounter, through the process of which the relation between the teenager and their parents either becomes diluted or consolidated. </p>
<p>Thesis:</p>
<p>In the excerpt from Dalton Trumbo’s Johnny Got His Gun, Trumbo establishes a harmonious and profound relationship between a young man and his father, both of whom are just encountering this special stage of life.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By employing serene setting, simple dialogue, as well as, heart-wrenching flashback details, Trumbo demonstrates to the readers that due to the mutual love and considerateness of the father and the son, their relationship was actually condensed by the boy’s inevitable growth.</p>

        <p>“Two miles” not only suggests long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountable differences between different social hierarchies.</p>
<p>“Trade so flat” suggests a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>“miserable looking women” “beggine expedition” suggest the penury state of Wilson’s life. “female beggars” are also suggesting Wilson’s future</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Carson’s world, I see the disregard to expense. The visual and olfactory imagery in the kitchen also fully demonstrates Casons’ luxury.</p>
<p>The  setting depicts a stark contrast between different social hierachies in order to demonstrate the gap between the oppressed workers and nobilities. At the beginning of the excerpt, Wilson needs to walk “two miles” to reach the house of Carsons. The simple but incredible number not only suggests a long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountble differences between different social hierachies. Therefore, it would be hard and even impossible for the Carsons to emphasize about the penury that lamentable servants suffer. On his journey, Wilson witnessse “trade [that is] too flat”, siltently conceying a sense of desolation that is far away from the rich. what are in Wilson’s eyes are also his own psychological portrait, like “miserable looking women” who are “begging for expedition”. Wilson, representing the servants who are beggin for satisfaction of their owners, is lamentable enough to notice the women with same mood. However, when it comes to the world of Carson, the readers see the disregard to expense. The visual imageries such as “roaring fire” “numbers of utensils” “boiled steaks” and olfactory depictions like the appetizing odour of steamed coffee fully demonstrate Carsons’ luxury which is completely unimaginable for the workers. Through the setting, the readers already can exactly feel the cruel gap between the poor and the rich, which also foreshadows the two groups’ distinct life styles and attitudes towards each other. By showing a conspicuous contrast, the readers not only witness the miserable life of  Wilson, but also develop a common vivid sense about how hierachy can decide the condition of life.</p>

        <p>The son and his father have a fishing tradition which suggests a harmonious and close relationship, which is also the reason why he feels uncomfortable to go fishing with Bill Harper this year. The son is also mature since he realizes “it was something that had to happen sometime” despite the fact that he was unwilling to break his father’s heart as he pretended to be casual when telling his father about this. He also respects his father very much as he carefully arranged his words like “if you don’t mind…”. </p>
<p>Father covered his sadness by pretending nothing happened: “why sure”. And here comes a flashback about how valuable the rod is to his father which was lend to his son no matter how disappointed he was deep down. “It was as simple as that and yet he knew it was a great thing”, the son actually can understand his father in a silent way although he was only 15 years old. “he felt a little lump in his throat”, the uncomfortable feeling the boy had demonstrates the <strong>mutual love and respect and comprehension</strong> —– harmony.</p>
<p> “campfire” connotates warmth. The fact that the camp is quite simple implies that the mere presence of each other has already provides both of them with a sense of comfort. The sound of pines like rain rustling symbolizes a peaceful environment and the pleasure of each other’s presence. This place of “nine thousand feet high” also refers to an isolated environment—–it feels like the exclusive and unique camp only belongs to the father and son. What a harmonious relationship! And I can see a personality of meek and considerate.</p>
<p><strong>The setting in the opening paragraph of the passage immediately set the tone as peaceful and harmonious, which lays an environmental foundation for the excerpt’s theme about the profound mutual love, respect, understanding between the father and the son. From the narrator’s perspective, profound love is not a turbulent chemical reaction catalyzed by enthusiasm, by passion, but rather like the campsite, serene, peaceful, simple, uniquely belonging to only the two characters, prompted by deeper affection between human being.</strong></p>
<p>The extremely peaceful setting characterizes the deep and serene love between father and the son. “campfire” connotates warmth. And this place of “nine thousand feet high” also refers to an isolated environment—–it feels like the exclusive and unique camp only belongs to the father and son. What a harmonious relationship! The fact that the camp is quite simple implies that the mere presence of each other has already provides both of them with a sense of comfort. The sound of pines like rain rustling symbolizes a peaceful environment and the pleasure of each other’s presence. The love is not as intensified as chemical reactions of which the heat would soon fade away. All those years’ silent company is the best way for the father and son to convey affection. </p>

        <p>The unexpected academic result in Drama 10 has pushed me a big step further towards the destination of self-aware. Born to be extremely introverted, I never expected a good result on this course when hearing about it is a compulsory one. Common redemptions were even kicked away from the field of drama in advance since I kept self-telling: this was born to be your weakness. Accept it. Don’t get frustrated when you turn to be the worst student on final transcripts. Life is full of drama. Even myself cannot believe that I came first academically with 99% on average. Perhaps myself was much braver than I have ever imagined? Realization comes to me that my attention was not distracted on high but unrealistic expectations anymore—every time receiving the task the only goal I hold was to get out of the comfort zone, bit by bit because I never gave in to self-defined personal traits deep down. Initial shyness in practice videos just stimulated my unwilling naturally which boosted the quality of performances. And now I am confident to tell the cool progress: I have turned my disadvantage into advantage. Thanks to this period, a brand-new self emerges who is much stronger than expected. What I define myself as is usually what others comment on me. That could be true. However, only personal traits can be defined, other than my consequential ability only if the heart of persistence is beating.</p>

        <p>I am proud of my outstanding ability to emphasize. I tend to be sensitive and spiritually supportive to my friends and family, and can also resonating with the emotions that literary works convey. Thus, I am free to go through the miseries that the characters are suffering, celebrating delights with them despite the gap between reality and illusion.</p>
<p>My world can be as rosy-pink as <em>The Tale of Despereaux</em>’s romantic tone, magical like Narnia, epic like <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> sometimes gloomy when reading <em>The Raven</em> and <em>Signalman.</em> This great skill always colors my mind.</p>
<p>After “experiencing” characters’ lives, the appreciation towards their distinct personalities stimulates my curiosity to discover some potential relationships. Dystopian works are my favorite: Lord of the Flies, Unwind, Maus, and Squid Game tell me about the downfall of human nature, focusing on children’s animal impulse, desire of escaping from the destiny of being unwound, the brutality of holocaust, and the fragile game of human nature respectively. No one can ever imagine the exhilaration of establishing a “Dystopia” theme park with <em>Lord of the Flies</em> Island with wild kids hunting, and <em>Squid Game</em> Park with discriminators shooting. As I keep on “feeling” their lives, the internal links among characters emerge which I consider to be the most fabulous stage. I gradually realize that <em>Squid game</em> is dramatically made up of the anatomy element from <em>Unwind</em>, human nature element from <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, concentration camps and crematorium element from <em>Maus</em>! I truly believe that their worlds are connected and intertwined in such context, and that is the most amazing experience since I am more emotionally linked to those characters more closely. I am not simply feeling their pain anymore. Empathy gives me the power to travel between fiction world. In this way, I am trying to find out more character- links and coincidences and ultimately find out the wisdom and truth behind it, to contribute interesting discoveries to the real world.</p>
<p>Empathy is a great skill because it understands the world.</p>

<p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,</p>
<p>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludges,</p>
<p>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,</p>
<p>And towards our distant rest began to trudge.</p>
<p>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,</p>
<p>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;</p>
<p>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots</p>
<p>Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</p>

        <p>Will Simultaneous Languages Input Lay Children in Danger?</p>
<p>Nowadays, quite a bunch of children at a young age are exposing to one and even more foreign languages. Take the bilingual country Canada as an example: Quebec is her only province whose majority is Francophone and so that the official language is unique. The truth is that the Quebec families are often mixed with anglophone, francophone, and sometimes even Native members. Even if a pure British-speaking family are “independently” thriving, children can never be guaranteed for not interacting with any different language speakers around the whole province (Wikipedia contributors, 2021). With this phenomenon, sociolinguists are worrying about whether there is an advantageous measure to pour languages into kids’ brains simultaneously (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.).</p>
<p>Communicative language teaching is a meaning-based approach in second language acquisition. In this case the potential-bilingually-speaking children can also master the target languages through simultaneous oral output. Then questions rise: can the children use the two (or more) languages separately without mixing them up, or in other words, avoid compelling conversations with random- languages-fragments? And if so, will they still be equipped with the basic skills of pouring out a complete sentence which only focuses on one language at one time? It sounds intimidatingly authentic. At the end of the day, unfortunately, it is proved to be necessarily concerned to some extent. According to the research, part of people’s misgivings are true—the languages can be combinedly used, sometimes not an unrest in language system (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.), but an case similar to what happens on second language learners—codeswitching. For instance, children’s daily English speaking can be alternated subtly with the use of another language. With the same kind of phenomenon occurring, second language learners find it helpful to change their language mode systematically in order to deliver a particular idea that requires “perfect bon mot to come across effectively” (<em>NPR Cookie Consent and Choices</em>, 2013). Or they simply feel necessary to use this language instead to make up for the disabled expression in previous tongue. Certainly, those children can be in the same circumstances, and therefore the combinations are just fine. But if the aforementioned “unrest in language system” comes true (since they do not share a foundation of the first language which is so solid that it almost won’t disturbing the new language learning), e.g. more easily to get confused with the similar words’ pronunciation in French and British respectively, the bilingual learning will definitely be slower in development (G. 2018). Children will absolutely need more time to clarify the differences between/among languages in consideration of further study.</p>
<p>Besides the potential disadvantages compared to second language learners, children benefit from something equally at last this time. As language drills overlaying like colors on paintings, their common underlying proficiency is emerging and then consolidating. It is about the set of “skills and implicit metalinguistic knowledge” a kid collects as he or she is learning one language which can be “drawn upon when working in another language” (Shoebottom, n.d.). Unlike second language learners, these kids can boost their common underlying proficiency twice every time from the simultaneous learnings in relatively a short period so that their learning can be promptly superior conversely. This is a great time-saving advantage. However, besides the “common zone” across two languages, the confusion often happens among microscopic pronunciation or grammar as aforementioned, and macroscopic cultural differences. Spanish and Portuguese share the similar language framework of Latin Languages. Children who study these two together certainly execute a win-win strategy. However, those from Chinese-American families won’t be so lucky since Mandarin and English are two independently developed languages. Therefore, beginning two languages can be quite challenging if “starting from zero”.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are potential dangers for young children to study two or more languages at the same time due to the lack of mother tongue foundation compared with second language learners who can learn L2&amp;3 one by one, or in other words, “in blocks”. They can get confused frequently without the concentration on only one foreign language. And even if children avoid confusion between languages, the difficulty of learning two totally unrelated languages doubles without benefiting from cultural context connection. But as more time spent on repeating, and children insisting, common proficiency can be developed that will gradually form a virtuous circle. No matter how, Parents should decide critically in terms of their children’s circumstances.</p>
