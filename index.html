        <p>The article “Everyone Has an Accent” works like a strewer, stabbing into my heart. I recall that I always laugh at my mom’s accent when speaking English despite knowing that she had never learnt English until she came into university. And through all those years of learning English and trying to approach the level of native speaker, I am always educated that my accent is a good way of judging whether a student is good at English, or even good at study. Many citizens would even laugh at some Chinese celebrities who demonstrate unprofessional spoken English. There is a sentence in the article that simultaneously caught my heart: “Accent by itself is a shallow measure of language proficiency, the linguistic equivalent of judging people by their looks.” This one is so great. To me, I felt very guilty and humble in international English writing workshops because of my Chinese accent. But I was ignoring the fact that I was selected because of my great writing skills instead of my accent. Accent is just a standardized thing. Vital stuff like culture and thoughts would naturally emerge and communicate whenever the accents are good or not.</p>

        <p>I failed my AP exams.</p>
<p>Everyone, except me, gets at least one 5.</p>
<p>That sounds really familiar…</p>
<p>In this year’s winter Olympic, Alexandra Trusova said something similar after she lost her gold medal: “everyone except me gets a gold.”</p>
<p>This makes me feel less guilty somehow.</p>
<p>Trusova became a landmark for successfully completing five quad jumps in a single performance. She had already challenged herself and made the history.</p>
<p>Similarly, I chose the two most difficult exams–AP English Language and AP English Literature. I can choose Calculus, statistics, and economics and get a collection of fives. But I want the challenge. And I love literature.</p>
<p>If Trusova didn’t challenge herself to do the “3A”, she might have won the gold.</p>
<p>If I didn’t challenge myself to take Language and Literature, I might have got three fives.</p>
<p>…Everyone, except me, gets at least one 5.</p>
<p>…Everyone except me gets a gold.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I was crushed by peer pressure, and I was disappointed. I believe so did Trusova.</p>
<p>But does she regret for doing 3A and five quad jumps? No.</p>
<p>Does I regret for taking the hardest exams? No.</p>
<p>We are both so brave that we care more about self-challenge than good results.</p>
<p>AP scores may be essential to my application. But I think I should not simply study for the application…or carefully manipulate my choice to get as many fives as I can. I should study for myself.</p>
<p>Columbus once said, “You can never cross the ocean unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.” I know it is very possible that I cannot get a five or even a four, but I would certainly take these exams, with no regret.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Sometimes the imageries in poetry not only create a poetic vibe, but also symbolize a reflection in reality. Swamp, from time to time “misanthropic” and ticklish and stark, works as a metaphor of life obstacles that the speaker needs to overcome in a poem. Therefore, the attitude towards this stinking mud implicitly reflects the speaker’s grit when facing problems. In Mary Oliver’s artful poem <em>Crossing the Swamp</em>, she initially develops an intense conflict and ultimately a perfect harmony between the speaker and the swamp by using techniques like figurative language and diction.</p>
<p>The use of figurative language like alliteration, end rhyme, and similar syntax effectively conveys a gradually-rising optimism towards the swamp. In the beginning, the poet depicts choking “belching” “bogs” that “the dark burred faintly” and the scary “branching vines”, with the alliteration of “b” sound repeated for four times which aggravates the intensity of a disgusting and horrifying panorama of the swamp. The speaker’s later “struggle” and “closure” then naturally emerge that explicitly reveals the speaker’s misery for involving in this catastrophe hell, which can be exemplified as considering the mud as “pathless”, “seamless”, and “peerless”. This repetition of end rhymes emphasizes the tremendous devastation that is deluge of power, implying the speaker’s endless helplessness and hopelessness. Through the lines with negative mood, Oliver also uses a similar syntax with the same beginning of “here is” to state the existence of “swamp” and “struggle”, consistently demonstrating the swamp’s overwhelming oppression to the speaker. Overall, readers can apparently witness a conspicuous conflict between the speaker and the devastating mud. Furtherly speaking, human beings are struggling against those obstacles with great anguish.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the intense relationship is gradually replaced by a sincerely awe to mother nature as an adroit selection of vivid dictions reveal. From the speaker’s point of view, the mires are not “slick” and “slack earthsoup” anymore, but “fat grassy” “succulent marrows” and “a breathing place”. The branches are not eroding in “the dark burred faintly belching bogs” anymore, but sprouting in “the whims of swamp water”. And the speaker even feels “painted” and “glittered”, instead of “dark” and “slack”. The conspicuous comparison points out speaker’s dramatic shift of attitude against the swamp, and more importantly, paints a sudden realization of the grandeur of the great land. The speaker originally believes that it is a dungeon taking his life, but now more firmly believes that it is a paradise of life. There is no fear of being swallowed to death anymore, but a deep appreciation towards the “nugget of dense sap”, so lively, such a gift of God, that offers no willingness in escaping, but an acceptance of human-nature convergence. This is stage when human beings gratefully respect learn from, and get used to the company of the obstacles rather than losing themselves when confronting distraction and pain that they would bring. This is rational psychological portray that helps overcome any difficulty.</p>
<p>Human beings and the nature, seeming to stand on two distinct sides superficially, go against each other in our common belief. However, thanks to Oliver’s Crossing the swamp, we get to realize that the veneration to the land stimulates the convergence of twain, which also suggests that our life is seamlessly intertwined with obstacles. There is not way to avoid problems. What we need to do is to fully respect and admire their existence.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare’s adroit use of effective figurative language  demonstrates Cardinal Wolsey’s complex feelings when facing sudden downfall. In the beginning, Shakespeare uses images like “tender leaves of hope” and “frost” as a metaphor of lamentation and self-pity.  However, Wolsey then compared himself to a “little wanton [boy] that swims on bladders”, realizing his naivety and incompetence and a state of self-retrospective. At last, an allusion of Lucifer that “never to hope again” demonstrates another irrational stage which is totally despair. The shifts of emotions altogether paint the complicated psychological portray of Cardinal Wolsey.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the excerpt, Milan Kundera uses juxtaposition of “dolce vita” and “risky return” to boost the suspense of the ultimate choice that “he chose”, which is adroitly involved in a periotic sentence that emphasizes his shocking decision–”the return”. This resolution is further underlined by the following two parallel sentences with relatable conspicuous contrasts followed by the anaphora of “Rather than”, altogether not only creating a sense of consistency and fluency that is easier to read, but also impressing the readers with memorable rhythm and symmetrical pattern.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The author uses literacy devices like diction and imagery to establish a mutually corresponding and aggravating  relationship between the setting and the protagonist, Raskolnikov, in the excerpt from <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. The chaotic but vivid imageries are depicted from the view of Raskolnikov. This implies that it is himself that chooses to see “scaffolding” “lime and brick and dust everywhere”, smell “the intolerable stench of the saloons” under this certain circumstance and atmosphere. What Raskolnikov subconsciously sees are completely agitating, which reflects and also aggravates “the deepest loathing” deep down, prompted by the disgusting setting.</p>
<p>What I think is a good example for me to learn from:</p>
<p>“With vivid and unique selection of details and diction to set up agitating, poignant tactile and olfactory imagery, Dostoevsky creates a realistic setting for the opening of his novel, the torrid, fetid, and chaotic summer day in St. Petersburg, which not only conspicuously mirrors the protagonist’s unquenchable agitation and misanthropic inclination that are aggravated even more by the repulsive setting incubated by the author’s elaborate selection of words, but also implies the further chaos and struggle in the story that the protagonist would have to encounter. For an extremely agitated person like the Raskolnikov, the summer in St. Peterburg is not just “hot” but “ferocious”, and what he smells from the street and the saloons is not just “smell” but “intolerable stench”. Both of the tactile and olfactory imagery created by the synchronization of diction with strong negative connotation creates the sense of chaos and agitation, stimulating not just “dissatisfaction” but “the deepest loathing” from the protagonist’s face, and “jarred instantly and unpleasantly” on his already unappeasably intense nerves, foreshadowing his upcoming inevitable mental explosion. The sensory imagery and the descriptive psychological portrayal of the protagonist adroitly created by the author’s careful selection of words are relatable to most readers, who share a common understanding about the inseparable relation between one’s mental state and one’s perception of the environment. Therefore, readers can feel clearly that it is Raskolnikov’s mental pandemonium that leads him to see, feel, and most importantly, be tormented by the chaos  in reality, and in the meantime, it is the chaos in the reality that elevate his mental pandemonium to an irrevocable level.</p>

        <p>Through adroit and subtle manipulation of narrative pace and sequence (paragraph idea), Trumbo strengthens the characterization of the father and the son and in the mean time reinforces the excerpt’s theme about their mutual love and considerateness (reflect thesis). In the third paragraph, in a simple, smooth dialogue without quotation marks, colons, or similar punctuation, marked by austere and simple syntactical pattern (narrative pace-evidence), Trumbo intentionally accelerates his narrative pace in order to demonstrate the boy wanted to accelerate his conversation with his father and therefore attenuate his choice about choosing Bill Harper. The accelerating dialogue implies the boy’s strong intention to not to hurt his father’s feeling, which shows his considerateness and maturity that is not so common in teenage boys.</p>
<p>Hook:</p>
<p>Growing up, cutting off reliance on parents and family, and finding new environment, companies, as well as lifestyle for adulthood is a natural and inevitable phase of life that any teenager must encounter, through the process of which the relation between the teenager and their parents either becomes diluted or consolidated. </p>
<p>Thesis:</p>
<p>In the excerpt from Dalton Trumbo’s Johnny Got His Gun, Trumbo establishes a harmonious and profound relationship between a young man and his father, both of whom are just encountering this special stage of life.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By employing serene setting, simple dialogue, as well as, heart-wrenching flashback details, Trumbo demonstrates to the readers that due to the mutual love and considerateness of the father and the son, their relationship was actually condensed by the boy’s inevitable growth.</p>

        <p>“Two miles” not only suggests long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountable differences between different social hierarchies.</p>
<p>“Trade so flat” suggests a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>“miserable looking women” “beggine expedition” suggest the penury state of Wilson’s life. “female beggars” are also suggesting Wilson’s future</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Carson’s world, I see the disregard to expense. The visual and olfactory imagery in the kitchen also fully demonstrates Casons’ luxury.</p>
<p>The  setting depicts a stark contrast between different social hierachies in order to demonstrate the gap between the oppressed workers and nobilities. At the beginning of the excerpt, Wilson needs to walk “two miles” to reach the house of Carsons. The simple but incredible number not only suggests a long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountble differences between different social hierachies. Therefore, it would be hard and even impossible for the Carsons to emphasize about the penury that lamentable servants suffer. On his journey, Wilson witnessse “trade [that is] too flat”, siltently conceying a sense of desolation that is far away from the rich. what are in Wilson’s eyes are also his own psychological portrait, like “miserable looking women” who are “begging for expedition”. Wilson, representing the servants who are beggin for satisfaction of their owners, is lamentable enough to notice the women with same mood. However, when it comes to the world of Carson, the readers see the disregard to expense. The visual imageries such as “roaring fire” “numbers of utensils” “boiled steaks” and olfactory depictions like the appetizing odour of steamed coffee fully demonstrate Carsons’ luxury which is completely unimaginable for the workers. Through the setting, the readers already can exactly feel the cruel gap between the poor and the rich, which also foreshadows the two groups’ distinct life styles and attitudes towards each other. By showing a conspicuous contrast, the readers not only witness the miserable life of  Wilson, but also develop a common vivid sense about how hierachy can decide the condition of life.</p>
