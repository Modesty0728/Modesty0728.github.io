        <p>Through adroit and subtle manipulation of narrative pace and sequence (paragraph idea), Trumbo strengthens the characterization of the father and the son and in the mean time reinforces the excerpt’s theme about their mutual love and considerateness (reflect thesis). In the third paragraph, in a simple, smooth dialogue without quotation marks, colons, or similar punctuation, marked by austere and simple syntactical pattern (narrative pace-evidence), Trumbo intentionally accelerates his narrative pace in order to demonstrate the boy wanted to accelerate his conversation with his father and therefore attenuate his choice about choosing Bill Harper. The accelerating dialogue implies the boy’s strong intention to not to hurt his father’s feeling, which shows his considerateness and maturity that is not so common in teenage boys.</p>

        <p>“Two miles” not only suggests long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountable differences between different social hierarchies.</p>
<p>“Trade so flat” suggests a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>“miserable looking women” “beggine expedition” suggest the penury state of Wilson’s life. “female beggars” are also suggesting Wilson’s future</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Carson’s world, I see the disregard to expense. The visual and olfactory imagery in the kitchen also fully demonstrates Casons’ luxury.</p>
<p>The  setting depicts a stark contrast between different social hierachies in order to demonstrate the gap between the oppressed workers and nobilities. At the beginning of the excerpt, Wilson needs to walk “two miles” to reach the house of Carsons. The simple but incredible number not only suggests a long physical distance, but also symbolizes the unsurmountble differences between different social hierachies. Therefore, it would be hard and even impossible for the Carsons to emphasize about the penury that lamentable servants suffer. On his journey, Wilson witnessse “trade [that is] too flat”, siltently conceying a sense of desolation that is far away from the rich. what are in Wilson’s eyes are also his own psychological portrait, like “miserable looking women” who are “begging for expedition”. Wilson, representing the servants who are beggin for satisfaction of their owners, is lamentable enough to notice the women with same mood. However, when it comes to the world of Carson, the readers see the disregard to expense. The visual imageries such as “roaring fire” “numbers of utensils” “boiled steaks” and olfactory depictions like the appetizing odour of steamed coffee fully demonstrate Carsons’ luxury which is completely unimaginable for the workers. Through the setting, the readers already can exactly feel the cruel gap between the poor and the rich, which also foreshadows the two groups’ distinct life styles and attitudes towards each other. By showing a conspicuous contrast, the readers not only witness the miserable life of  Wilson, but also develop a common vivid sense about how hierachy can decide the condition of life.</p>

        <p>The son and his father have a fishing tradition which suggests a harmonious and close relationship, which is also the reason why he feels uncomfortable to go fishing with Bill Harper this year. The son is also mature since he realizes “it was something that had to happen sometime” despite the fact that he was unwilling to break his father’s heart as he pretended to be casual when telling his father about this. He also respects his father very much as he carefully arranged his words like “if you don’t mind…”. </p>
<p>Father covered his sadness by pretending nothing happened: “why sure”. And here comes a flashback about how valuable the rod is to his father which was lend to his son no matter how disappointed he was deep down. “It was as simple as that and yet he knew it was a great thing”, the son actually can understand his father in a silent way although he was only 15 years old. “he felt a little lump in his throat”, the uncomfortable feeling the boy had demonstrates the <strong>mutual love and respect and comprehension</strong> —– harmony.</p>
<p> “campfire” connotates warmth. The fact that the camp is quite simple implies that the mere presence of each other has already provides both of them with a sense of comfort. The sound of pines like rain rustling symbolizes a peaceful environment and the pleasure of each other’s presence. This place of “nine thousand feet high” also refers to an isolated environment—–it feels like the exclusive and unique camp only belongs to the father and son. What a harmonious relationship! And I can see a personality of meek and considerate.</p>
<p><strong>The setting in the opening paragraph of the passage immediately set the tone as peaceful and harmonious, which lays an environmental foundation for the excerpt’s theme about the profound mutual love, respect, understanding between the father and the son. From the narrator’s perspective, profound love is not a turbulent chemical reaction catalyzed by enthusiasm, by passion, but rather like the campsite, serene, peaceful, simple, uniquely belonging to only the two characters, prompted by deeper affection between human being.</strong></p>
<p>The extremely peaceful setting characterizes the deep and serene love between father and the son. “campfire” connotates warmth. And this place of “nine thousand feet high” also refers to an isolated environment—–it feels like the exclusive and unique camp only belongs to the father and son. What a harmonious relationship! The fact that the camp is quite simple implies that the mere presence of each other has already provides both of them with a sense of comfort. The sound of pines like rain rustling symbolizes a peaceful environment and the pleasure of each other’s presence. The love is not as intensified as chemical reactions of which the heat would soon fade away. All those years’ silent company is the best way for the father and son to convey affection. </p>

        <p>The unexpected academic result in Drama 10 has pushed me a big step further towards the destination of self-aware. Born to be extremely introverted, I never expected a good result on this course when hearing about it is a compulsory one. Common redemptions were even kicked away from the field of drama in advance since I kept self-telling: this was born to be your weakness. Accept it. Don’t get frustrated when you turn to be the worst student on final transcripts. Life is full of drama. Even myself cannot believe that I came first academically with 99% on average. Perhaps myself was much braver than I have ever imagined? Realization comes to me that my attention was not distracted on high but unrealistic expectations anymore—every time receiving the task the only goal I hold was to get out of the comfort zone, bit by bit because I never gave in to self-defined personal traits deep down. Initial shyness in practice videos just stimulated my unwilling naturally which boosted the quality of performances. And now I am confident to tell the cool progress: I have turned my disadvantage into advantage. Thanks to this period, a brand-new self emerges who is much stronger than expected. What I define myself as is usually what others comment on me. That could be true. However, only personal traits can be defined, other than my consequential ability only if the heart of persistence is beating.</p>

        <p>I am proud of my outstanding ability to emphasize. I tend to be sensitive and spiritually supportive to my friends and family, and can also resonating with the emotions that literary works convey. Thus, I am free to go through the miseries that the characters are suffering, celebrating delights with them despite the gap between reality and illusion.</p>
<p>My world can be as rosy-pink as <em>The Tale of Despereaux</em>’s romantic tone, magical like Narnia, epic like <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> sometimes gloomy when reading <em>The Raven</em> and <em>Signalman.</em> This great skill always colors my mind.</p>
<p>After “experiencing” characters’ lives, the appreciation towards their distinct personalities stimulates my curiosity to discover some potential relationships. Dystopian works are my favorite: Lord of the Flies, Unwind, Maus, and Squid Game tell me about the downfall of human nature, focusing on children’s animal impulse, desire of escaping from the destiny of being unwound, the brutality of holocaust, and the fragile game of human nature respectively. No one can ever imagine the exhilaration of establishing a “Dystopia” theme park with <em>Lord of the Flies</em> Island with wild kids hunting, and <em>Squid Game</em> Park with discriminators shooting. As I keep on “feeling” their lives, the internal links among characters emerge which I consider to be the most fabulous stage. I gradually realize that <em>Squid game</em> is dramatically made up of the anatomy element from <em>Unwind</em>, human nature element from <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, concentration camps and crematorium element from <em>Maus</em>! I truly believe that their worlds are connected and intertwined in such context, and that is the most amazing experience since I am more emotionally linked to those characters more closely. I am not simply feeling their pain anymore. Empathy gives me the power to travel between fiction world. In this way, I am trying to find out more character- links and coincidences and ultimately find out the wisdom and truth behind it, to contribute interesting discoveries to the real world.</p>
<p>Empathy is a great skill because it understands the world.</p>

        <p>Will Simultaneous Languages Input Lay Children in Danger?</p>
<p>Nowadays, quite a bunch of children at a young age are exposing to one and even more foreign languages. Take the bilingual country Canada as an example: Quebec is her only province whose majority is Francophone and so that the official language is unique. The truth is that the Quebec families are often mixed with anglophone, francophone, and sometimes even Native members. Even if a pure British-speaking family are “independently” thriving, children can never be guaranteed for not interacting with any different language speakers around the whole province (Wikipedia contributors, 2021). With this phenomenon, sociolinguists are worrying about whether there is an advantageous measure to pour languages into kids’ brains simultaneously (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.).</p>
<p>Communicative language teaching is a meaning-based approach in second language acquisition. In this case the potential-bilingually-speaking children can also master the target languages through simultaneous oral output. Then questions rise: can the children use the two (or more) languages separately without mixing them up, or in other words, avoid compelling conversations with random- languages-fragments? And if so, will they still be equipped with the basic skills of pouring out a complete sentence which only focuses on one language at one time? It sounds intimidatingly authentic. At the end of the day, unfortunately, it is proved to be necessarily concerned to some extent. According to the research, part of people’s misgivings are true—the languages can be combinedly used, sometimes not an unrest in language system (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.), but an case similar to what happens on second language learners—codeswitching. For instance, children’s daily English speaking can be alternated subtly with the use of another language. With the same kind of phenomenon occurring, second language learners find it helpful to change their language mode systematically in order to deliver a particular idea that requires “perfect bon mot to come across effectively” (<em>NPR Cookie Consent and Choices</em>, 2013). Or they simply feel necessary to use this language instead to make up for the disabled expression in previous tongue. Certainly, those children can be in the same circumstances, and therefore the combinations are just fine. But if the aforementioned “unrest in language system” comes true (since they do not share a foundation of the first language which is so solid that it almost won’t disturbing the new language learning), e.g. more easily to get confused with the similar words’ pronunciation in French and British respectively, the bilingual learning will definitely be slower in development (G. 2018). Children will absolutely need more time to clarify the differences between/among languages in consideration of further study.</p>
<p>Besides the potential disadvantages compared to second language learners, children benefit from something equally at last this time. As language drills overlaying like colors on paintings, their common underlying proficiency is emerging and then consolidating. It is about the set of “skills and implicit metalinguistic knowledge” a kid collects as he or she is learning one language which can be “drawn upon when working in another language” (Shoebottom, n.d.). Unlike second language learners, these kids can boost their common underlying proficiency twice every time from the simultaneous learnings in relatively a short period so that their learning can be promptly superior conversely. This is a great time-saving advantage. However, besides the “common zone” across two languages, the confusion often happens among microscopic pronunciation or grammar as aforementioned, and macroscopic cultural differences. Spanish and Portuguese share the similar language framework of Latin Languages. Children who study these two together certainly execute a win-win strategy. However, those from Chinese-American families won’t be so lucky since Mandarin and English are two independently developed languages. Therefore, beginning two languages can be quite challenging if “starting from zero”.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are potential dangers for young children to study two or more languages at the same time due to the lack of mother tongue foundation compared with second language learners who can learn L2&amp;3 one by one, or in other words, “in blocks”. They can get confused frequently without the concentration on only one foreign language. And even if children avoid confusion between languages, the difficulty of learning two totally unrelated languages doubles without benefiting from cultural context connection. But as more time spent on repeating, and children insisting, common proficiency can be developed that will gradually form a virtuous circle. No matter how, Parents should decide critically in terms of their children’s circumstances.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>To those friends who have read both <em>Unwind</em> and <em>Lord of the Flies</em>:</p>
<p>A simple but profound question: <strong>is it ever possible for groups of young children who live without mental illness to choose to give up their lives willingly?</strong> Well, before reading the two novels, I would consider this piece of statement as the most absurd. But as you all know, through reading you can experience distinct lives of numerous characters. Their encounters make me believe in something impossible in real life. So, I guess you are still recalling why those kids wanna go dying so firmly. Alexander Hamilton has actually given us the answer. He said, “There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself.” And if we now take a review of the two novels, we would find out that the cases when children give up their lives happen when their liberty reaches the peak. Well, you may think: every kid want liberty! How can liberty be their killers? So now, let’s take a deep dive into the two novels.</p>
<p>The first one: <em>Unwind</em> by Neal Shusterman. It tells that in the future, although abortion is illegal, parents can choose to sign the Unwind Order to “dismiss” their unwanting kids and donate their parts to medical uses. The word “unwind” here just means to dismember. So just imagine that your parents decide to divide your soul just because you haven’t come first in recent exams and they tell you nothing before the juvie cops take you away from them forever. Spontaneously some children become an AWOL, which means that they go on exile like a prisoner. But actually, the AWOLs own extreme liberty since <strong>they have the choice to decide whether to live on (or in other words being unwound since you are technically alive on recipients), or die.</strong> Holding the life-and-death choice means extreme freedom. Those children are free spiritually despite being traced by juvie cops and their parents assigning the Unwind Order. They don’t want to obey the parents who do not love them and the dystopian world that cruelly decides their fortune without their permissions. They seem to be the ones with the least freedom, but the moment when they light up the courage to escape from this crazy world, they are totally free spiritually. They can choose to end the exile life and “continue” their lives “technically”. But most of them would rather “stay whole”, and “die wholly”. In this case, this group of children says, “I would rather die than being unwound.”, as a protest to the crazy world.</p>
<p>Similarly, children in LOF also get the whole liberty.</p>
<p>It talks about that due to a plane crash during the world war, a group of children have to stay and survive on an isolated island. There are no adults at all and as time flies by, civilization is fading away so that the children’s animal nature begins to emerge. Imagine that: no adults. Nearly every kid is exhilarated since they can do anything they want. However, it is exactly their enviable liberty that gradually diminishes their desire of seeking help. Civilization is fading away along with the boost of liberty. Children become impulsive and only “live in moment”. They fall in deep love with nature, and become savages who only addicted to hunting. Ultimately, they do not care about creating big fire to attract attention to get rescued anymore. In other words, the children actually choose to give up their lives when facing the charm of hunting. In this case, children in Lord of the Flies say, “I would rather go hunting than being rescued.”</p>
<p>So what can be summarized from the two cases? For children, extreme liberty can not only lead to savagery physically, but also spiritual freedom. The combat between the children from Lord of the Flies and Unwind exemplifies the impulse of giving up life versus the courage of giving up life. Whether liberty means a good thing is about whether giving extreme liberty to bodies or spirits. If children choose to give extreme liberty to spirits, then they only die physically (Unwind). (Verse versa). And we almost all agree that only spiritual death says effective goodbye to the world. Those who only die physically continue the life of their spirits. To sum up, Lord of the Flies demonstrates the degeneration of human nature while the reverse is true for Unwind when all the children are offered the same precious thing: liberty which can be a double-edged sword.</p>

        <p>In the first leadership class, Mrs. Ardhy lead us to gone through the proper process of dealing with crisis, which is getting know what is going on -&gt; decide quickly -&gt; communicating -&gt; terminate the crisis and move on, according to my personal summary. In the beginning I thought that it is really a tough thing to deal with since we have quite many procedures to follow and I did not consider myself having such kind of ability. However, after Office Hour, I learnt that we can also and should be optimistic when facing conflicts in team work since I should be glad that my team is so diverse and unique. I believe it is the same for the crisis. Not only should we keep an optimistic mind when dealing with crisis in order to utilize our confidence to solve the problem, optimism but also means that I have an open mind to the diversity and colourful minds in my team. Thanks to those distinct thoughts, I can get the precious chance to witness the existence of crisis. And that is what makes my team success in the future.</p>

        <p>An idiom is an expression that cannot be understood from the meanings of its separate word but has a separate meaning of its own. Idioms are not simply about languages anymore, but the <strong>epitomizer</strong> of local culture that gives special implication to surface meaning and definitely has profound impact on human mindset about how to understand a language flexibly in different circumstances. Applied to our project, why are there so many idioms about gender equality in China and Arab countries? Because of their sexism folk cultures. And eventually, gender stereotypes are solidified in people’s mindsets.</p>
