        <p>\1.   WHO AM I?</p>
<p>Satine is a dancer and courtesan, who is known as the legendary “sparkling Diamond”. She has to hide her deep love to Christian in order to protect Moulin Rouge from the Duke. She is lack of freedom since she can never choose who to love. She finally dies due to Tuberculosis.</p>
<p>\2.   WHERE I AM?</p>
<p>Satine is in Paris, France. And her affiliation is Moulin Rouge. Satine is actually the star of Moulin Rouge</p>
<p>\3.   WHAT SURROUNDS ME?</p>
<p>Work in Moulin Rouge so work together with Zidler (owner of Moulin Rouge and friend)’s “Diamond Dog Dancers”. Also surrounded by the audience who are always watching her performance. However, because she is the “Sparkling Diamond” which means that she is outstandingly beautiful, there are always a bunch of men around her, like the duke and Christian who Satine falls in love with. Some of them are not glad experiences… for instance, the duke actually plagues Satine much for blocking the love between Satine and Christian. Her surroundings actually put a huge impact on her. She has no right to decide who to love and whether to be healthy. People around her make all the decisions for her. So, this question is actually pathetic for Satine, for this tragedy.</p>
<p>\4.   WHAT TIME IS IT?</p>
<p>In the early year 1990.</p>
<p>\5.   WHAT ARE MY CIRCUMSTANCES?</p>
<p>Satine is the star courtesan at Moulin Rouge. Her collapsing onto floor during performance has already given us a hint of her illness. Satine succumbs to tuberculosis eventually. Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she told him to write their story.</p>
<p>\6.   WHAT ARE MY RELATIONSHIPS?</p>
<p>Satine’s true lover is Christian. She actually gets friends at Moulin Rouge, like her boss Zidler. Abd also she is forced to have a relationship with duke who does want to own her although Satine herself does not love him at all. She is admired by loads of men due to her pretty appearance.</p>
<p>\7.   WHAT DO I WANT?</p>
<p>Satine definitely wants freedom and love. All the decisions about her are made by people around her and she cannot love someone that is disapproved of her boss.</p>
<p>\8.   WHAT IS MY OBSTACLE?</p>
<p>Satine’s obstacle are all the people around her and her own identity. She cannot fall in love with anymore, which is claimed by herself. She does love Christian, but their love cannot be discovered or Moulin Rouge would be in danger. The Duke is the big obstacle, but that also reflects that the biggest obstacle is her identity and the society.</p>
<p>\9.   WHAT DO I DO TO GET WHAT I WANT?</p>
<p>Although Satine is in great fear of her love being discovered by the duke, Christian and she actually are brave enough to interact with each other under the duke’s nose. Her great courage and the eager towards true love offer her short experience of romance. Satine is brave enough to express herself.</p>

        <p>UTA HAGEN</p>
<p>Questions for Character Study</p>
<ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am Evelyn, a housewife with perfect posture. I’m distant from my daughter India and my husband Richard. I’m quite jealous about the bond between Richard and India as they go hunting together all day and what I only can do is to get their preys stored. I’m alcoholic. Actually, drinking helps me escape from life and the jealousy. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>Always at my big house, with Stokers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>A luxury house. Loads of servants. My daughter India is always with me although keeping distance with me. My husband leaves me but his brother Charlie comes who lets me feel the sense of romance once again.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know…</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I lose my husband on my daughter India’s 18th birthday. It was a great shock… however, I am an unstable woman, and the sudden presence of my husband Richard’s brother—Charlie is much to my delight! Charlie recalls my memory of young Richard. Gradually, Charlie and me grow intimate as India refuses to get rid of melancholy and relax. Actually, my daughter is so distant…You know, it is just because I’m so lonely deep down and find it hard to get close to Stokers. I admit that I am just vulnerable like other woman, eager to get my husband’s company and love. On a beautiful evening, India’s great aunt Gwendolyn makes a visit to our house which is very much to my dismay. She suggests me to pay attention to Charlie and once again speaks of my dead husband Richard. I was flattered by the emerging romance so ignored what she was saying and was sensitive and a little bit guilty when my husband was mentioned… But all of that does not influence my more and more intensified feeling for Charlie at all. So, can you ever imagine how astonished it is to witness my own daughter grows closer to Charlie and eventually intimate? My heart is full of hatred. I burnt out everything from my husband and the preys hunted by my daughter, and then coldly expresses the desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie. I have already “realized” what happened to India’s big aunt and Mrs, McGarrick. I only ask for Charlie to get my daughter go. But once again, I’m totally intrigued by Charlie’s charm and he tries to seduce me with his belt suddenly! He calls India to come here, and my dear daughter is with a rifle. I thought she would kill me…but Charlie is shot.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>India is the daughter if Richard and me although both of them seem distant from me. The appearance of Richard’s brother Charlie makes me satisfied since for the first time India can never steal love from me anymore. Later, I do find Charlie suspicious, but his great charm still steals away my ration.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I always want to be cared and loved by the man. I want to get closer to my husband and daughter. I want to get back to the time that Richard is still intimate with me. Later on, after discovering the relationship between Charlie and India, I want India, my own daughter, to suffer. In the end, I want Charlie to stay away from India.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>My husband leaves me so there’s no chance to rebuild our relationship again. My daughter is absolutely a “Stoker”. The stokers enjoy the satisfaction of killing, which makes it impossible for me to get closer to them. And for my wish to let India suffer…I do hate her for what she has done…what I still love her. India is my hope. She is the reason why I had a child. I want to utilize her to improve my relationship with my husband. And what kind of person Charlie really is rejects my hope towards love.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to get closer to my husband, I had a child. And to be loved and accompanied by a man, I build up a close relationship to Charlie. In the end, I try to warn Charlie to get away from my daughter by talking and warning.</p>

        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as the nineteenth century, feeding and experimenting on pigeons which were selected according to individual traits (Hooper, 2017). Obviously, human beings have been exploring this field for centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting to the environment, normally the advantageous living beings would be chosen to provide people with a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection of which “genetic materials are artificially manipulated” according to the definition of GMO. In other words, GMOs are created “against nature”. Our research focuses on the first consuming-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon) created by AquaBounty Technologies (Nordrum, 2020).</p>
<p>This biotechnology enlarges salmon’s size (comparatively a doubled size in a certain growing period), and the time they take to grow to market size is halved compared with conventional Atlantic salmon which are definitely slow growers with a 32 to 36 months’ life circle approximately (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). </p>
<p>So far, only a few countries have been using this method to improve salmon’s quality, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon came down in pike in 1989, Canada, which could grow all year around rather than just in spring and summer (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). On November 19th, 2015, with food and environmental safety both ensured, AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon came into season with the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon. </p>
<p>So, what are the details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon are originally Atlantic salmon inserted another two special genes from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Ocean Pout. Generally, the scientists transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs. Therefore, the original (Atlantic) ones manage to grow faster in warmer seawater. All ultimate products are sterile females (The Fish Site, 2010), which directly diminishes the concern of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with disapprovals based on salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, it has been backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that GM salmon are domesticated (The Fish Site, 2010). Current results also indicate that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors” because of the low quantity requirement of food resources. However, although it finally became true that FDA approved the GM salmon, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) refuse to have GM salmon sold in their stores (Shreeves, 2019) as GMO labels are never required on AquaBounty Salmon—consumers could be unaware of the particularity of what they have just eaten. It is also being said that AquAdvantage salmon contain less nutrient—“producing less of the beneficial omega—3 fatty acids than non-GMO salmon” (<em>Say NO to GMO Salmon + Full-Length Feature Online: Salmon Confidential</em>, 2013). There are worries based on the survival of wild animals and human health indeed, but undeniably AquAdvantage salmon benefit the environment. For instance, they actually improve the conservation of wild fish populations. As aforementioned, the demand for food decreases. That sustains the aquaculture effectively. Moreover, where GM salmon are bred is very close to the grocery store, which lowers carbon emissions during transportation. AquaBounty is also perfectly capable of recycling waste water and resources (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). </p>
<p>“GMOs” has always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about its pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new genetic product came out, and how scientists argue, raising up questions, analyzing, researching…We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are relatively friendly to the earth. No matter what would happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate and continue the great efforts put in this field which promote the development of genetics.</p>

        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, feeding and experimenting on pigeons which would be selected based on their traits.

The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection of which “genetic materials are artificially manipulated” according to the definition of GMO.

<p>Currently, only a few countries use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina.

AquAdvantage salmon are originally Atlantic salmon inserted another two special genes from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Ocean Pout.

All ultimate AquAdvantage salmon are sterile females, which directly diminishes the concern of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with the disapproval based on salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, it is backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that the final product is domesticated. Preliminary results also say that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors”. However, although it is possible and finally becomes true that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the final product, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) refuse to have GM salmon sold in their stores as a GMO label is never required on AquaBounty Salmon. In this way, the consumers could be unaware of the particularity of what they have just eaten. It is also being said that AquAdvantage salmon contain less nutrient—“producing less of the beneficial omega—3 fatty acids than non-GMO salmon.” There are worries based on the survival of wild animals and human health indeed, but undeniably AquAdvantage salmon benefit the environment… for instance, they actually improve the conservation of wild fish populations. As aforementioned, their growth time is reduced by nearly 50%. That sustains the aquaculture effectively.

<p>The size of GM salmon is much larger than its non-transgenic siblings, and the time it takes to grow to market size is half time as conventional Atlantic salmon. Also, they can grow to market size in about 16 to 18 months. The transgenic salmon shows a doubled size comparatively in a certain growing period. </p>
<p>Before artificial selection, salmon’s growth cycle is 32 to 36 months. They’re slow growers, and in the first year of life they may achieve a weight of between 20 to 30 grams.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries in the world use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon was created in 1989, in Canada. People used artificial selection to salmon that grow all year around, instead of only growing in spring and summer. On 19 November 2015, after confirming its safety for food for five years and environmental safety for three years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon for marketing.

        <p>So glad but melancholy to finish our <em>Unwind</em> as the end of term 3… I have learnt so much since the winter holiday, and just watch how many blogs are related to this one…</p>
<p>Before I thought my perspectives are untouchable authorities. Now it is so funny but touching to look back and see how many times my opinions has been beat and then reformed. Mrs. Smith suggested us to be open-minded on the first class starting <em>Unwind</em>. And now I’m proud to tell that I did it. What remains to do is firstly edit my compare and contrast essay, sending it to Mrs. Smith, and most importantly, revise the Unwind Project to make my dream come true. It is the first time that I start to analysis an English novel so deeply and has been provoked so many thoughts towards human nature. But I also suggest myself to improve my reading method due to all the awful quizzes marks. Next time just try not to be so “deeply”… you are just trying to hard…</p>
<p>As a remembrance and enthusiasm, I have started the second book of Unwind series– UnWholly and really found something that made me link back to Unwind. Good luck for the furthermore exploration of Unwind series!</p>

        <p>The universe is infinite and no one is sure about its capacity, but that allows human beings’ wild imagination and exploration. They discover the technology of unwinding and grafting, however their stupidity also grows wildly along with the crazy exploration. Stupidity now does not imply that unwinding is totally absurd. It is suggesting we have been only focusing on what’s the next research to do rather than stopping for a while and reflect on ourselves. Pathetically is we ignore this suggestion, our stupidity turns infinite. I believe the author is just reflecting on what happens in the book. People make a compromise between pro-life and pro-choice, but they never stop to think further…</p>

<p><strong>Another figurative meaning by using this as the final destinations of the Unwinds.</strong></p>
<p>I do think it is a profound choice to make Graveyard the final destination.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s irony here. The introduction of Part5 says, “Graveyard is not a land where abandoned planes piled up”. Unwinds here actually have something to do and the abandoned planes here are in symbolism of them. It emphasizes that the Unwinds’ final destination won’t be nothing but waiting for death. They are going to prove themselves meaningful.</p>
<p>Moreover, “keep active aircraft flying” refers to using effective parts to fix an aircraft. I think it is implying the intension of the Admiral to save the Unwinds from being into pieces and ensure their safety. </p>
