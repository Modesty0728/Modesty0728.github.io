        <p>Recently, I’m taking two AP courses, namely Microeconomics and Calculus and I’ve found these tasks hard to deal with due to my poor time management and new knowledge’s being difficult to take in. What I can do now to improve the situation is out there, clearly. Firstly, keeps using the To Do APP which preventing wasting time and helps self-realization. Also, just don’t give up! It’s never too late to correct the mistakes, so, utilizing the days around New Year’s Day to catch up with your mates with online recorded videos which is absolutely for Calculus and just review the points again and again for Microeconomics. I believe I own the ability to get 5 in the end. And even though I do not want to, ask teachers as frequent as you can. Please don’t be shy.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I choose this topic because when I was reading and analyzing <em>O! Me! O! Life!</em> I started thinking about my own verse of contribution and immediately my eager of being nice to others came into my mind because it is exactly my true deep feeling. I think the question raised by the topic is quite important to me since the question helps me put my own experiences and feelings into deeper consideration and comprehension. There are loads of revision of this piece of work because it is the first time I work on a slam poetry. To make it achieve the standard of slam poetry, I actually spent loads of time creating rhyme scheme, repetition and looking for slang. The whole poem demonstrates my own thoughts: winter syrup represents both the speaker’s feeling when getting along with others and the speaker herself while to some extent the contributions of the speaker (represents the real me) and winter syrup are same, so the speaker’s contribution to this world is actually herself (it is actually a equivalent substitution in Math). And for these few lines: </p>
<p>Winter syrup flows inside body:</p>
<p>carefully creeping on my tongue,</p>
<p>lightheartedly running in my stomach,</p>
<p>easefully disappearing in the end.</p>
<p>I just want to show that the speaker feels sweet like having the syrup before, while and after she shows kindness to others. The sweet feeling is divided into three stages in the order of time, e.g. “carefully creeping” and “tongue” means the state which is before the speaker shows kindness. Also, in the poem I show the speaker has a thinking period:</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tik tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup sounds familiar!</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tick tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup compares with moving pointer of clock.  </p>
<p>I do not want my readers think that the speaker is so smart that she could get any truth without struggling. “Tik tock” and “clock” here indicate the speaker is thinking and linking syrup to herself. And I add “winter” before “syrup” because in this way the warmth and happiness of syrup can be better emphasized:</p>
<p>True warmth comes in winter,</p>
<p>’tis the season</p>
<p>when I become meaningful. </p>

        <p><strong>Winter Syrup</strong></p>
<p>I ask myself,</p>
<p>in appreciation</p>
<p>of the world, what is your contribution?</p>
<p>Consideration? Consolidation? Consumption?</p>
<p>Conservation? Operation? Imagination?</p>
<p>Interaction? Instruction? Invention?</p>
<p>Or the love to the nation.</p>
<p>Yeah, all are my anticipations</p>
<p>but they are never put into action.</p>
<p>After cogitation,</p>
<p>I cannot help but think of the confection.</p>
<p>Pathetically just for consolation.</p>
<p>Oh, confection!</p>
<p>In my heart it is in the form of syrup penetration.</p>
<p>Everyday I praise all the surroundings,</p>
<p>like Olaf in winter</p>
<p>“I am Olaf and I love warm hug!”</p>
<p>But intensely I want to offer my own hug:</p>
<p>push the door open for myself</p>
<p>while waiting for others as well;</p>
<p>order the meal hearty for myself</p>
<p>while smiling at waitress as well.</p>
<p>Winter syrup flows inside body:</p>
<p>carefully creeping on my tongue,</p>
<p>lightheartedly running in my stomach,</p>
<p>easefully disappearing in the end.</p>
<p>So now I ask myself again,</p>
<p>What is your contribution?</p>
<p>Ah! Happiness! Kindness!</p>
<p>Yeah, I gonna yell out these words.</p>
<p>Curiously.</p>
<p>That is exactly the contribution of syrup.</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tik tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup sounds familiar!</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tick tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup compares with moving pointer of clock. </p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I got the answer.</p>
<p>Syrup is the feeling,</p>
<p>the feeling then forms me.</p>
<p>Now I am the syrup,</p>
<p>thus myself is the contribution.</p>
<p>True warmth comes in winter,</p>
<p>’tis the season</p>
<p>when I become meaningful. </p>

        <p><strong>On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Franz Joseph’s nephew, and Countess Sophie were assassinated by a young Serb in Sarajevo. Balkans, the powder keg, is exploded.</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1908, Bosnia was taken over by the Austrians and three years later, a Serbian secret society namely <strong>Unity Or Death</strong> (which is also known as “Black Hand”) was eager to get all Slavs of the Balkans into one country so aiming to get control of the Serbs near Bosnia. Definitely there would be tensions between Austria and Serbia. However, the Austrians made an unwise decision—their newspaper alleged that Ferdinand was going on a visit to Bosnia to review troops. Ferdinand’s intension was to scare Serbia but his act also offered Black Hand a chance to kill him and threaten. Also, the day that Ferdinand and his love Sophie arrived in Sarajevo was exactly Serbia’s National Day…</em></p>
<p>Ferdinand and his wife arrived in Sarajevo at 9.30 in the morning and were driven to Town Hall via Appel Quey in a motorcade. Six “killers” had already got prepared when the motorcade turned onto Appel Quey. Nevertheless, among them, neither Mehmedbašić or Čubrilović reacted. The situation changed when the third operative, Čabrinović, a young Bosnian, threw a hand grenade. Unfortunately, the bomb only detonated the limousine’s collapsible roof. Failing the task, </p>
<p>Čabrinović also failed to suicide so was arrested. Then, the motorcade escaped the death from the next three assassins (Popovic, Princip and Grabez) again because Popovic was short-sighted and Grabez chickened out and the cars were moving too fast. The “dramatic journey” did not end yet. After the couple arrived at Town Hall, the tour was soon cancelled. Austrian Governor advised a new route and the motorcade decided to backtrack. But they forgot to tell chauffeur the change of plan and when they were driving along Franz Joseph Street the Chauffeur finally realized the mistake. He then stopped and turned around at Schiller’s Store. By coincidence, Princip, who failed mission before, grab the opportunity at once and fired two shots. Ferdinand and Sophie soon died at 11.30 a.m. </p>
<p>“The world is right to be alarmed,” said a woman in London Street. “The conflicts in Balkans are never solved so this incident is inevitable.”</p>
<p>We agreed that the tragedy happened in Sarajevo is like another eruption of volcano. And now, the clashes and hatred between Serbia and Austria is like the whirlpool. Triple Entente and Triple Alliance would soon be sucked into, sending shock waves through the world. Yes, a great war is coming and let’s get prepared. </p>

        <p><strong><em>the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. “Peer Pressure.” Merriam Webster, March 2018, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Peer-Pressure-104.aspx.Accessed">https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Peer-Pressure-104.aspx.Accessed</a> 24 November, 2020.</em></strong></p>
<p>Our project work is related to peer pressure and I’m searching for information on the internet to learn this phenomenon better. This valuable website shows a clear definition of peer pressure and provides for categorized suggestions in terms of different groups of people.</p>
<p>Peer pressure is a feeling that one must act same as people in one’s age and social group in order to be regarded and respected. It is natural and beneficial for children to interact with friends as they grow and mature and actually peers play a vital role in the social and emotional development of teenagers. Their influences which can be either positive or supportive begin at an early age and increase through the teenage years. For the good aspects, peers are helpful in fostering one’s new skills and interests in numerous social and daily activities and events. On contrary, with the same strong level of effect, peers can also egg their companions on delinquencies and even risky behaviors, e.g. skipping classes, theft, cheating, remaining addicted to drugs or alcohol, etc. Due to the results of peer pressure, the majority of teens with substance abuse would begin using drugs of alcohols. This terrifying pressure can appear among both real life and social media. However, minors are always in concern of being left out or made fun by peers so would go along with the group.</p>
<p>There are still some tips on dealing with peer pressure. For teenagers, they need to stay away from “dangerous” peers and learn to say “no”. Meanwhile it’s very good for them to get in touch with other peers who resist peer pressure and talk to a reliable adult. When it comes to the parents, they are responsible to communicate with teenagers honestly and teach them the ways to resist. The friends and teachers of teens can be a useful target to share concerns with. Also, parents ought to prepare the backups in case of unpredictable situations for them. Last but not least, if the grown-ups manage to convert their children into the assertive ones, less likely such pressure would be gained. </p>
<p>All the information above is vital to my research. First of all, a clear definition is demonstrated so that it’s easier to understand the problems we are facing and the factors behind. Moreover, the advice is adaptable for the consideration of all groups of people who are able to improve the situation. In this way, I can draw conclusions of the available methods to solve peer pressure where our main subject is exactly focusing. </p>

        <p>Compared to what I learned before, this film’s depiction of issues in Canada was more specific. From other group’s “deadlock” presentation, I got to know there were clashes among different parties, however the film demonstrated the stiff situations in terms of loads of debating and cliques which helped more in understanding.</p>
<p>It also changed my perspective towards the process leading to Confederation. Before watching I believed the evolution of Government was smooth-going. But it turned out to be a tortuous process since Cabinet stepped down several times before the coalition and the leaders would change their allies based on interests.</p>
<p>To solve the headache of political deadlock and American threat, George Brown, from Clear Grit Party, abandoned the proposal of separating the colonies and allied with leaders of Liberal-Conservative Party and Le Parti Bleus, namely Macdonald and Cartier in order to create possibilities for double majority which enabled Government to function and pass laws to build defense against the US. </p>
<p>Overall, the main theme was the essential passion for the birth of a country. In the beginning, politicians made judgements depending on proposals of own parties rather considering the colonies as a whole, e.g. Brown disapproved the construction of railway as he thought this way to achieve modernization was a theft of the public purse. Gradually, due to the threat of the USA and the concern of losing the very nation, Brown suggested acting together to reform the constitution. Spontaneously Confederation was achieved in the end to protect the common homeland. In other words, the film showed stronger and stronger identity of Canadiens.</p>
<p>I felt exhilarated to the film because of the great idea of Confederation. When Macdonald came up with this idea and Brown chose to stand by him, their faces shined in the sunlight. Those two scenes were the climax, heartening and indicating the coming of a historical moment. Naturally I perceived a historic trend of unity both in the film and Chinese history, e.g. CPC fought against Japanese with KMT which protected China’s dominion. Also, as unity is strength, a bundle of sticks can be hardly broken despite I’ve tried my best. The film really resonated with me. </p>

        <p>Edgar Allan Poe once said, “We loved with a love that was more than love.” It seems like sometimes “love” is just a word for expressing rather than a true deep feeling even people themselves are not conscious of. In one of Poe’s most famous poem, <em>The Raven</em>, he wrote about an “absurd” “communication with a raven in a gothic style, giving vent to the melancholy for the loss of love nearly in his delirium. Absolutely this indicates the purpose of this piece of work is more than “the raven”, and the “intangible love” can be exactly reflected by the theme: seeking hope in despair is struggling. </p>
<p>Sometimes the theme is also “intangible”. The speaker could no longer distinguish between illusion and reality. Pathetically, he thinks the raven is sent by the angles to help forget pain (Poe, lines 87-89). The poor man is so eager to meet the love again that the extreme melancholy makes him hallucinate. He does not recognize it as a ridiculous thought about imagination. But it is crucial to notice that the illusion is a way of “seeking hope” for the speaker. Perhaps it sounds romantic, but behind it is the hysterical screaming in heart.</p>
<p>One of the objective factors leading to despair is the cruel reality closely related to hard life of the speaker. In the last stanza, the melancholy soul is trapped in the raven’s shadow forever (Poe, lines 107-108). “Nevermore” is repeated and emphasizing the eternal loss of the love Lenore several times. The speaker’s communication with the raven is more like a talking to another part of himself. The raven symbolizes the great loss in heart so the shadow of the raven is actually reflecting speaker’s intense pain. Maybe readers do not know how torturous it is, but the speaker has suggested that he would not get rid of the sorrow anymore by using the word “trapped”. Pathetically the dead cannot get back and the speaker is in such a deep love. The cold and heartless actuality makes speaker a decadent who is even tired of driving the raven away and cheering himself up.</p>
<p>Looking for solace is another form of “seeking hope”. The speaker surceases the disconsolate emotion through reading (Poe, line 10). There’s no doubt that he tries to numb himself through distractions and utilize the discourse to release sadness. Also, even though no one is outside the door, the speaker keeps whispering “Lenore!”, demonstrating the desire to meet the love again (Poe, lines 28-29). The wish is also a piece of comfort the speaker wants. For the speaker, calming himself down is hard, hence “seeking help” is about the same.</p>
<p>The theme, about “struggling”, can be proved through exploring its causes and extra meaning in <em>The Raven.</em> The speaker’s struggle seems lamentable in the pain of the loss of Lenore, but he is also showing a tenacious spirit. The past is in the past, and mortals’ power is impossible to change history. Maybe they are stuck into sorrow inevitably, but the struggle for hope is always meaningful which proves the meaning of their existence, the love.</p>

        <p>Do a thirteen years old child have an effective self-control？The answer is no. Imagine it, even an adult has difficulty of reducing time on the internet, how can a child be success? What is of great importance is that the “difficulty” can generally lead to children’s getting negative information from the internet. To be specific, children under 13 should not be allowed on social network considering their mental health, and time management.</p>
<p>Varieties of information on social networks can silently addict children, thus the online stuff keeps them away from reality which causes mental isolation. According to a survey carried out by Benedick University and Proston College in 2014, children feel more anxious and stressful during face-to-face communication after using the social network to interact with others. Nowadays minors use apps like Facebook to contact with friends or family due to the development of electronic technology and the social conduct of pro-online. As they gradually get used to share thoughts online which avoids stress caused by oral communication, relying on this safety zone without embarrassing themselves. Nevertheless the loneliness in terms of mental isolation prevents children from expression which is phenomenal for exploring creativity, thus minors remain rigescent. </p>
<p>Social networks can also disrupt children’s time management. Spontaneously, their daily schedule change, damaging the physical health. Since too much time is spent on “virtual wonderland”, kids fail to be organized and then come to the disruption of internal clock representing the unregular resting time. According to a recent research about the status-in-quo of children’s use of network, the number of five-year-old minors who spends over thirty minutes in browsing internet has already achieved a half. As kids grow older, the time occupied by devices would only escalate. Pathetically, the physical health of young ages is essential for the whole life’s well-being as a matter of fact. In other words, the addiction on the internet could have a profound implication on children, damaging their well-being forwards. For instance, staying up late leads to a decline on intelligence.</p>
<p>All in all, due to the concern of children’s mental and physical health, the date for going online ought to be delayed, assumed as a necessary protection against the distemper prospect. These two factors are the most fundamental ones categorized from obvious facts e.g. dreadful time-organization. To deal with such issues, great effort needs offering to guarantee minors with a thriving future for they are the world’s “future”, the hope every person depended on.</p>
