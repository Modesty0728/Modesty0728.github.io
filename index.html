        <p>Florida, The United States of America</p>
<p>March 28th, 2021</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! My name is Modesty Zhou, coming from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China. I’m remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite scientific novel ever! It is so exhilarating for me to have a chance to show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I was when reading the part of Roland getting unwound…which is the most tremendous episode of this book. “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman when I was reading I saw myself! You know, lying in the bed with flood of grievances washing out reason, rushing my whole body almost burning on fire. No one comes to comfort me. I thought my body will soon burn out. It feels like squeezing a sponge. Fury flees out leading to continuously exert even though the sponge has been squeezed into the size of nail. At that time fire spreads out wildly, from skin to heart, then to nowhere… fury begins to retaliate— no place to burden right? Then I would invade into your soul… we will see the depth of your soul. Yeah…fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should be turned in ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Actually, I understand every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I almost can see a little soft baby with heart on fire… can you imagine that… the purest creature in the world with the “nature demon” addicted to killing. How could I tease Roland before after “experiencing” his real life? Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, you let me see myself. I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> feeling. Now a tragic Unwind silently demonstrates my locked pain…everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the sense of despair in Roland’s heart. Roland and me are not the same, but here the magic of reading comes…maybe you only see a sentence of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that man…and oh you are totally that man! Empathy is now intensified— overlap of life trace is the distillation of empathy.</p>
<p>​    Your language is entertaining, bring little fresh and fragrant air to adjust the stifling atmosphere, like lively kids. I love this part so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed, half fruity. To be honest, the beginning and parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy and stifling…</p>
<p>Part 2 impresses me so much which tastes like Christmas frosting given the favors a lovely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time. That is because of several insightful philosophies in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous, original and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what <em>Unwind</em> attracts me most is how much it leads me deeply into the thinking towards human nature. I never have dug into such philosophical and insightful topic before. Your novel brings me into a brand- new world, profound and amazing, most surprisingly connected with my real life— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc.<em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory nature. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, because if his assassination succeeds, he may become a brave hero. Also, before becoming a real assassin, Macbeth suffers the torment of conscience. Everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it’s not our fault, but the struggling of human nature. That’s why the “perfect world” is not a perfect world. Only the neutralization of bad and good can makes us valuable and lively. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the test sent by God would eventually begin on each person. Therefore, they are less likely to find the real self and see the world with misunderstanding. This sentence makes me confused and even dissentient for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.”</em> I once felt Nurse Greta is indifferent and marble-hearted. Nevertheless, in the end I found out that Connor ironically received the arm from the unwound Rolland. I begin to think that whether unwinding is completely wrong since I had been so stubborn before… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds. It’s time for head above stifling and dangerous water. It’s like our attitude towards water: may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> really offers an unrestrained secret garden to think, think, think about myself, about the world.</p>
<p>​    After reading, I’m also eager to ask for the answers to some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other. It sounds dramatic to me because I’ve been always thinking that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side since most of the story focuses on how the Unwinds fight against the Unwind Order. However, as aforementioned, I now find out that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you write more discourses to support the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Also, in part four we come to the topic of the soul. I read a lot of dialogues about it and also think a lot. I’m sure that no one in this world can certainly deny or prove the existence of soul, which is why soul brings out so many discussions. Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always have the intension of “setting Lev free”? It’s quite contradictory to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believed Pastor Dan was waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But later he said he still keeps his faith…</p>
<p>​    I really enjoy <em>Unwind</em> because I think it recessively but amazingly shows the reality of human nature. For instance, the novel begins with the story of Connor. When I first read this part, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I found out his slight but vivid changes: Connor was intimidated by the prospect. Actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. It tells me that some Unwinds’ tough exterior hides a sensitive and vulnerable soul. Courage makes us strong, but its developing progress from fragility makes us outstanding.</p>
<p>​    Thank you so much for offering the world such a wonderful book. You can never believe how much I start to think about the world, about the human nature.</p>
<p>Your faithful reader,</p>
<p>Modesty Zhou</p>

<p>Questions for Character Study</p>
<ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a teenage girl who is typically plain. When facing others’ teases, I stay humble and melancholy but still carefully tries to be myself— to do what other girls may do to make myself pretty.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>By the registration desk for the Galaxy Girl Pageant with chairs nearby, out of school.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>The registration desk, the registration paper, a pen, Tara, a bunch of chairs</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Afternoon/dawn.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register for the Galaxy Girl Pageant… I don’t know whether I’m overconfident or blind… (when I put on those heels at home, I felt <strong>a little bit exhilarated</strong>— I’m acting like a princess! It wouldn’t be too bad compared with other girls…) Although still timid and humble, I light up my courage, pretending to be perky, to say “yes” and register. However, Tara points out my white feather deep down and sharply. In great sadness, Tara keeps convincing me to drop out… but I believe I can stand any of the teases and insults. Maybe just <strong>I believe</strong>… I haven’t given up yet thanks to plenty of practices done which makes me feel invincible. So weird Tara is! Her confusing actions provoke my hidden sense of inferiority— yeah, the pretties are with the pretties and I’m do hurt by what Selene said. All the trials out of the comfort zone, like registering the pageant, is aiming to get myself out of the labels— “plain”, “boring”, “not worthy hanging out with”. I’m not giving up. I want to prove that people like Selene are wrong. But Tara’s passionate comfort pulls me out of the hidden fury and bigoted decisions. She makes her sacrifice outrightly, and eventually we come close to each other.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>Tara is my best friend and I found Selene distant who makes me feel humble and worthless.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register the Galaxy Girl Pageant to show that I’m also pretty compared with anyone else.</p>
<p>More importantly, deep down I want to rebuttal the people who define me as “boring” and “plain”.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>\1.   Tara teases me for my plain appearance</p>
<p>\2.   The sense of inferiority due to other people e.g. Selene’s judgement.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I light up my courage to get out of my comfort zone. Register the Pageant and practice wearing heels a lot… what I am doing is aiming to be myself rather than remaining intimidated by the insults.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>u How does the author keep you in suspense in the first page of this chapter?</p>
<p>Connor wakes up in a medically induced coma, unconscious for two weeks which seems like eternity. His body is wound with bandage and the ache from whole body still doesn’t go away. However, everyone should know that Connor is the key Unwind, he couldn’t be released. Therefore, the nurse who comes to look after him might still someone working for Happy Jack Harvest Camp… Connor and Risa may still under the control of harvest camp and can get unwound later. The whole explosive actions happened before would worth nothing…like a big joke.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is ironic that Connor received the particular transplant that he did?</p>
<p>It seems quite ironic because Connor is the one who said “I would rather die than receive a piece of Unwind” before and he tried to run away from the destiny of getting unwound desperately. But now, he received a eye and an arm during his unconsciousness— he got something he never wants…he got something that comes from the procedure he ever wants to escape from. It must be astonishing and scary for Connor to accept. Yeah, it may seem ironic to Connor himself, but it was not his <strong>choice.</strong> Actually, this scene changes my attitude towards unwinding quite a lot. You see, Connor is always the one I appreciate, consistently fighting against unwinding, fighting for human rights. But when he is in then danger of dying, our superhero also needs organisms to survive, to fight back again. I think that’s why New York Times gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Now I wouldn’t be so outright like before emphasizing that unwinding is totally an unethical thing to do. I would be more open-minded. Maybe there are no right or wrong for the compromise between pro-life side and pro-choice side. God throws this tuff question to the world, just in aims of awaking us from blindness and staying open-minded. Fight for what you love, and accept the rest. Just as Nurse Greta said, <strong>“Love the ones you can, pray for the rest.”</strong></p>
<p>u What does Risa think Connor has changed into (end of chapter)?</p>
<p>Risa thinks Connor has changed into a man from a boy. It isn’t Connor’s age makes him man— it is how much he has grown up. The sense of naïve and impulsive have faded away. Connor’s soul was tamed by his impulsiveness. However, after having gone through so many difficulties, his soul begins to tam any other threats.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev’s lawyer talk to him about ‘insanity like it’s a good thing’?</p>
<p>Because from the lawyer’s point of view, he or she needs to stand by the side of Lev and to protect his life from unwinding. Insanity for becoming a clapper actually saves Lev’s life due to the chemicals in his blood. Therefore, “insanity like it” is a good thing for Lev which get him out of unwinding destiny.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is fitting that Connor has taken over the Graveyard?</p>
<p>Connor is probably the most suitable leader of Graveyard.</p>
<p>\1.  He owns a good reputation and authority— from the “rumor” of Akron Unwind to what happens at Happy Jack Harvest Camp, the Unwinds respect and believe in him.</p>
<p>\2.  He owns excellent leadership. Connor unites all the Unwinds in Graveyard to contribute to what they are fighting for.</p>
<p>\3.  Connor can now handle this responsibility. The courage of risking for life remains while the impulsiveness for acting without thinking vanishes.</p>
<p>\4.  Connor’s previous experiences are closely related to this place. He knows it well.</p>
<p>u Is the final message of the novel a positive one? Why?</p>
<p>It is a positive one, at least for Connor. Someone he loves, good friends, and all the kids facing the Unwind Order are all with him. Connor knows that now he doesn’t need to fight alone anymore. More importantly, he can see hope despite the threat of being exposed, which offers courage for all the Unwinds to live on.  </p>

        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile.

        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”.</strong> Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins caring about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>u Why are the questions Risa is being asked so disturbing?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>“You seem to be in good physical condition. You’ve been getting a lot of exercise, yes? Running, perhaps?”</strong></p>
<p>The staff here do care about the physical health of the Unwinds. However, through observation towards a basketball game, Risa realizes that the harvest camp is actually caring about their values, rather than they can lead a healthy life or not. She definitely feels offended because every Unwind here is priced as something waiting for sell, which is like the value evaluation of pork. And no one here cares about the Unwinds anymore.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>“Over the next few weeks you’ll be involved in a program of diverse activities. Risa, dear, are you listening? Is any of this going over your head— would you like me to slow down?”</strong></p>
<p>The harvest counselor defines any Unwind as an imbecile who needs someone talking to them to slow down to help them understand, even for some beyond average Unwind like Risa. Risa feels like the counselor holds ridiculous stereotypes towards Unwinds, which also makes her outraged.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>“Most of the questions don’t matter at this point… but if you have any specific skills you’d like to let us know about— you know, things that could be of use to the community during your stay here…”</strong></p>
<p>It is almost the same question that is always used to question an Unwind— “What good are you?” Risa feels like everyone is suggesting that an Unwind must be worthless. Once again, Risa experiences the indifference of the world.</p>
<p>  In conclusion, Risa feels the questions so disturbing due to the whole world’s misunderstanding and indifference to Unwinds.</p>
<p>u How does the camp’s daily routine make the Unwinds seem to be like?</p>
<p>Risa once imagined the harvest camp to be a human- cattle- stockades. Although Happy Jack Harvest Camp looks distinct to that imagination, Risa’s anticipation is actually true. The Unwinds are like a group of pigs, evaluated, and then wait for slaughter.</p>
<p>u Why are the tithes treated differently to everyone else?</p>
<p>They are not captured to come here— they are totally willing to go. People see them as a gift to the god, rather than someone causing trouble and offending the god. They treat tithes specially and carefully to “help” tithes complete their common destiny.</p>
<p>Also, the special treatment also seems like a sarcasm to the terribles, which are indicating that they do not deserve any special treatment.</p>
<p>u What does it tell you about the Unwinds state of mind that they would attempt to jump off a two-storey building in order to stave off Unwinding?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Actually, the Unwinds can be devastating.</strong> There is no other way to stave off unwinding. They can only choose to hurt themselves to win a chance of survival, which is quite lugubrious. Although they seem surprising towards this hopeful plan, the Unwinds must be sentimental. They may have gone a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>u How has Lev’s attitude towards tithing changed since the very start of the story?</p>
<p>In the beginning, Lev found being a tithe honorable and condescending, but also a little bit confused as he would feel intimidated by the prospect from time to time, almost involuntarily. That scared feeling comes from his nature, which is much weaker than the result of being brainwashed. Yet after the School Event, Lev became totally confused with his identity. The only thing that he was sure about is that Lev ought to re-recognize himself. After getting along with CyFi, Lev burnt the fire of hatred towards the people who signed the Unwind Order.  Lev must have recalled his own family when seeing CyTy with his parents. The reason he got so furious is probably because what happened in front of him reminds him that his own parents were also so indifferent when sending him to get unwound. That’s why Lev totally changed his attitude towards tithing. Lev’s recognition of human nature finally dominates his mind. When Lev makes up his mind to join the clappers, he’s heart is filled with fury and hatred towards this identity, this world. The identity of tithes only means a good cover for him to release dissatisfaction towards the world. </p>
<p>u What is ironic about Roland finally being ‘worth more than any other kid’ in his unit? Why is Roland being denied a priest?</p>
<p>\1.  Roland is unwound like all the other terribles. No one cares whether Roland is dominant or worthy among all the Unwinds. He ends up like all other Unwinds: into the unconsciousness forever.</p>
<p>\2.  No one except tithes are permitted to be accompanied by a priest, and Roland is the same as all the Unwinds to the surgeons, which means that he has no right to require a priest.</p>
<p>\3.  Roland owns a valuable blood type, which makes him “worthy”. However, due to his “value”, he is ordered to get unwound sooner than any other Unwinds.</p>
<p>\4.  Because priest is for people who are dying. However, the surgeon thinks that being unwound is absolutely not dying— Roland would still stay alive, just in a different way.</p>
<p>u Why do they keep the unwinds alive during the unwinding process?</p>
<p>Because it is regulated by the law that the Unwinds must be conscious about what is going on on them during the whole procedure. Maybe by this way, someone who carry on the Unwinds Order would be less guilty— after all the Unwinds default what they are doing.</p>
<p>u How is the tree a metaphor for the Unwinds?</p>
<p>\1.  The original tree is grafted with numerous limbs that makes it show a multitude of distinct flowers. This refers to how the Unwinds “function”. They are just like the distinct flowers on the same tree— the same recipient. However, here the pastor are showing how useful the tithes are, which can reflectively shows that it is the Unwinds that makes a recipient colorful and lively.</p>
<p>u Do you think the way Connor faces his unwinding is brave? Or do you think he has given up?</p>
<p>I think he is definitely very brave rather than having given up. If Connor has gives up, he won’t get rid of the guards’ hands and walk on his own. In the beginning, Connor’s mind messes up which is full of the desire of being alive. But then he makes up his mind to use all rest of time appreciating <strong>who he is.</strong> so Connor, positively, walks forward and appreciates as many views as he can.</p>
<p>u What is ironic about Lev’s final destructive actions in the end?</p>
<p>\1.  Although Lev has changed a lot— become crueler, indifferent. However, that is actually a cover that protects his real nature— I want to stay alive. Actually, as a clapper, he is brainwashed again, which is hidden clue in the plot. This time, he does not choose to obey someone that brainwashes him. Instead, he chooses to fight for what is truly in his heart. The irony can be Lev’s parents’ brainwash, because this time Lev is not affected by surroundings. It can also be ionic for the other clappers since there’s someone finally not so crazy and blind as any other of them.</p>

        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”. Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins caring about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>
