        <p>I do think that the Kardashians have had a negative influence on beauty standards. The family is adored by many people around the world with labels such as “hot” and “socialite”. Kardashians are frequent social media users which entice young girls to imitate. According to the video, tons of girls cannot conceal their desire to “be a Kardashian”. It seems like Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty magnify these girls’ figure defects which is never something to feel shame about. Kardashians have set girls’ beauty standards away from reality. This would also lead to too many similarities in aesthetics, so Barbie dolls are not for sell anymore—they are everywhere, since girls become Barbies. Besides Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty standards, there are also “consuming” their beauty. They claim that girls all over the world can own the “perfect” figure as themselves by using Kardashians’ products. They are clever—Kardashians utilize girls’ anxiety to make money, and the cost of money makes these girls think that they are doing something meaningful and correct. In this way, the rationality of holding unrealistic beauty standards are corroborated.</p>

        <p>Aristotle once believed that at some places of the world, “the sky was vomiting little bits of flames”. So what are the “flames on sky” exactly? If you look up in North and South poles, nowadays you would still probably see spectacular beautiful lights, especially at nights. These are auroras, also named as polar lights. They are the colored curtains glittering in northern and southern regions of the world. </p>
<p>Some people may get used to calling it “northern lights”. Actually, both North and South pole offer free aurora tickets for tourists. They only differ in names—aurora borealis in the Arctic and aurora australis over its opposite land. Generally, they exceed the Earth’s surface by 80-250 kilometers, which is the height of upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>The oldest record of aurora traces back to Tribal Period of China. The emperor—</p>
<p>Shuan-Yuan’s mother once saw intense lights flowing around Bei-Dou’s constellation. Later, sketch depicted auroras as “clouds with candles burning above”.</p>
<p>So, how is aurora formed? Thanks to our old friend—the sun, people can enjoy such spectacular universal view. Due to the rapid temperature variation, this big radiative star often gives off steady solar wind by bubbling, however there could also be extreme weather. When solar storms approach the Earth, here comes the beginning of universal miracle. According to NASA, solar energy comes into and then reconfigure the magnetic field where tremendous energy is eventually released in forms of electrons and protons. These energetic particles hit and ignite the oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. Usually, red and green auroras are related oxygen while the purple and blue luminous body is nitrogen. Therefore, we can see colorful skies in polar areas. Normally, every 11 years, the spectacle reach the peak. Pathetically, air pollution is affecting global atmosphere. Contemporary luminance falls to the weakest on record according to a senior advisor of NASA. </p>
<p>If you think the Earth is the only wonderland to take a look of polar lights, then you may want to expand your knowledge about the space! The only necessities for an aurora to show up are: solar storm, planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. Up-to-now, scientists have detected auroras over Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. Their colors differ, owing to different compositions of elements in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Astrology researchers are still unsure about whether the phenomenon of aurora exists out of the Solar System. But who can refuse the charm of these mysterious ethereal sky-silks? Let’s hope that one day we can be amazed at the undiscovered polar lights.</p>

        <p>Recently a doctor was detained by police for selling fake drugs to a patient. The patient was suffering from cancer while there were no effective drugs to maintain his health. Reluctantly, the doctor suggested seeking help from India where fake drugs are legal. This is a desperate decision. The doctor knew that fake drugs are not permitted in China. But, in order to save his patient’s life, he decided to take a risk. Dramatically, many people on Weibo started to intercede with the police since what the doctor has done was out of kindness. At last, he is successfully released.</p>
<p>However, according to what is posted on newspaper initially, the doctor is still recognized as a criminal. In this situation, legalization overweighs ethics. So, here comes a dilemma. It is the doctor’s duty to save the patient, but China also forbids fake drugs. I believe the journalism should prefer legalization as a higher code to emphasize China’s legislation. After all, China regards fake drugs as illegal due to its unsafety. It is still unsure whether these low-cost drugs can one-hundred percent benefit the patients or not. And for the ethics part, people online behave rationally—suggest releasing the doctor ethically. In this way, the law is solidified and also people don’t fall the ethics. </p>

        <p><strong>The characters</strong></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> A virtuous girl who would never give up own life facilely.</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> ME’s mother. A great woman who would risk her life to save her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> A girl who named after flowers.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> HYACINTH’s mother. She has low yearly income.</p>
<p><strong>Scene one</strong></p>
<p><em>(The outline of a building is demonstrated in the background. A wall in the middle which separates two families. The furniture and white wall are not shining anymore—big fire is spreading from downstairs. Black smoke is everywhere on stage. A big wooden bookcase is standing in the left corner while the family on the right has a bed placed besides the middle wall. Loads of blood-donation certificates are scattered on nightstand. A bottle of water tips over, spilling water out.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*MOM *trying to find a towel for</em> ME <em>to cover nose. On the other side of the stage,</em> HYACINTH <em>is awakened by stifling toxic gases.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Honey, come this way! <em>(point at the backstage)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(cough)</em> Don’t wait for me! Go! <em>(Fire dances to be a dividing line between</em> MOM <em>and</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p>​    <em>(*HYACINTH *is off the bed, frightened)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> <em>(weep)</em> where are you mama?</p>
<p><em>(*HYACINTH *picks up the bottle and tries to drive away the fire ghost by splashing the tiny amount of water left. However, that only makes herself surrounded by a fire circle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(already near the backstage, wave at</em> ME*)* Come on! Dear!</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(continue coughing)</em> I can’t get to you… </p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *collapses.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> No! Sweetheart!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *maneuvers across the fire wall. Successfully, she gets to her unconscious daughter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Oh, please! <em>(desperate)</em> Wake up! Wake up! <em>(gently and then rapidly shake</em> ME*)*</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> Help! Help! Anymore hear me? Please! <em>(harms around herself)</em></p>
<p><em>(The fire is approaching</em> HYACINTH. She climbs on her bed, although she knows that won’t help either.<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> HELP!!! <em>(kiss ME’s cheek)</em> I won’t leave you. Never.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The fire starts to suffocate</em> MOM*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hard to breathe)</em> You are the most virtuous girl in the world. And I always know that. <em>(tears cannot stop falling down)</em> </p>
<p><em>(Fire is now eating</em> HYACINTH’<em>s pajamas.</em> HYACINTH <em>is threatened into the corner and can no longer struggle anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> I guess this is the end. <em>(grin)</em> Mama, I love you, and I remember to have courage and be kind in my last moment… <em>(weaker and weaker)</em> Forgive *(whisper)*…me…</p>
<p>   <em>(*HYACINTH *is swallowed by fire. She is gone)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(almost faint)</em> Mom is here. <em>(pat</em> ME<em>’s pack)</em> No need to be afraid.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, the bookcase in the corner shakes violently, tending to fall onto the ground. It is heading for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(yell)</em> No!!!!!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *throws herself over ME. The bookcase falls on her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hysterical)</em> Ugh— </p>

<p><strong>MOM.</strong> (mumble) Hope someone will love you as I do.</p>

<p><strong>End of scene one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene two</strong></p>
<p><em>(The background still remains the same. The middle wall disappears. Now we only focus on the family on the left. The furniture has turned into ruins. Beside sparks lies the ember. The bookcase holds its position.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*ME’s fingers *start to move. At first,</em> ME <em>is stuck by something heavy above her.</em> ME <em>musters forces to climb out of the “mountain”.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> What’s so heavy?! <em>(get free eventually)</em></p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *sees</em> MOM <em>not moving anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(joking)</em> Mommy! Don’t imitate me anymore! <em>(smirk)</em> Such a bad day…ok, I’m totally fine now. See? Come on! <em>(baby voice)</em> Hug me! </p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *doesn’t sink into</em> ME<em>’s arms.)</em> </p>

<p><strong>ME.</strong> NO, no, no, no, no… <em>(Facial expressions are distorted.)</em> </p>
<p>​    <em>(<em>ME</em>’s eyes are dilated with horror. Trembling,</em> ME <em>tests the heartbeat.)</em></p>

<p>​    <em>(*ME *walls and weeps for a long time.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(sob)</em> Come back…please…COME BACK!</p>
<p>​    (ME <em>shakes the body again and again. Nothing happens.</em> ME <em>cannot stop crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(convulsive)</em> You said you will always by my side…You…you said you will never let me suffer…You said you are always there to hug me…Why tell the lies, mommy? Why leave me here to suffer alone? I miss the viridescent hyacinths you used for decoration…I miss your kiss…I miss you voice. Come back! Cook breakfast for me! How dare you forget about that? I will die without you. Are you willing to see that? Mom…HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE ON???</p>
<p>​    <em>(The ceiling begins shaking. The building is collapsing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I don’t wanna go…I won’t leave you.</p>

<p><strong>ME.</strong> Sorry mom.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The whole ceiling begins to fall down.</em> ME <em>takes the coat, with no courage to deliver</em> MOM <em>another glimpse.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>End of scene two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene three</strong></p>
<p><em>(A clammy wind blew up which seems to dim the glittering train station. A luxurious cosmetics store is seated at the right half of the stage with its front door facing the right backstage and backwall halving the stage so that people in the left stage cannot see what happened on the other side at all. A wooden bench covered with fallen leaves is placed in the left half besides the railway. A clock ticktocks in the middle of the background, beneath which a sign reads “Welcome to MOTHERLY STATION</em>—<em>remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart!”)</em></p>
<p><em>(Wearing an ill-fitting coat,</em> ME <em>is frozen up.</em> ME <em>lies on the bench, envious and lonely. Young ladies’ exhilarating laughter lingers around the station.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(weak and pale)</em> There… are… bound <em>(pound the bench with a trembling fist)</em> to be some </p>
<p>methods of getting food money without begging…</p>
<p><em>(Train flashes by.</em> ME <em>had a flash of inspiration.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> No, no it was… <em>(pause)</em> vicious, definitely.</p>
<p><em>(World War III broke out in my brain.)</em></p>
<p><em>(a recording is played at the backstage: “You are such a virtuous girl!”, lingering around the stage.</em> ME <em>heads up instantly with tears and also a sense of guilty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> But… nothing is left for me now, mom… <em>(wipe the tears away)</em> Please forgive me. I don’t </p>
<p>care who I am anymore… I only want to live… on! <em>(firm but struggling)</em> And I would return it </p>
<p>back in the end… The virtuous girl is gone.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *takes out my cellphone slowly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I’m sorry.</p>
<p><em>(Taking a deep breath,</em> ME <em>dials a casual number.</em> <em>“Du—”</em> ME<em>’s cellphone began to alarm.</em> ME <em>looks around nervously, pressing on heart with ragged breathing.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere. It is from the cosmetics store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Umm, I— </p>
<p><em>(A lady steps out of the store reluctantly, clinging on to her muddy cloak which seems to come from the opposite world of the brightly lit luxury store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(whisper)</em> So Sorry. Hang on a second. <em>(turn to the store)</em> I’ve already </p>
<p>told you that I can afford none of these!</p>
<p><em>(*ME *freezes, and then painfully closes eyes in self-accusation while giving</em> <em>herself a slap. But before</em> ME <em>hangs up the phone,</em> MIDDLE-AGED LADY <em>continued—)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(take a deep breath, and grin)</em> Forgive me, dear. You know </p>
<p><em>(optimistic)</em> salesmen can be extremely annoying sometimes. So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(frustrated and guilty)</em> Umm, uh…madam… <em>(inhale deeply)</em> your child is my friend—</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You mean Hyacinth?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(guilty look)</em> S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> I mean, Hyacinth! You definitely know that! What a perfect name! <em>(lost in memory)</em> In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and *(tentative)*—is she at home now?</p>
<p>(Suddenly MIDDLE-AGED LADY falls silent.)</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> No. She is not here.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help! She— <em>(ME have tried best to shout out anxiously.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(decisive)</em> She needs money, right?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(pretend to be steadfast)</em> Yes.</p>
<p>​    <em>(Silence seems like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(ponder)</em> I will definitely give enough money to people in need.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter! </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You know, <em>(suddenly)</em> you must be a virtuous girl, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Not really…</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *nearly cries out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s just a duty to care about minors.</p>
<p><em>(Tears stood in</em> ME<em>’s eyelashes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> If you accept, <em>(step forward)</em> let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *cannot stop crying.</em> ME <em>covered mouth with hands in order to make no sounds while the whole body is rapidly shaking.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(release)</em> Madam! I’m sorry!! What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be <em>(pause)</em> alive. You are the only <em>(snap)</em> person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MIDDLE-AGED LADY *is gratified.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Dear child <em>(chuckle)</em>, This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the “wicked” idea has been defeated by your conscience.</p>
<p><em>(In place of tears, there is the beginning of a smile for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I… <em>(wipe tears away and look gratefully at the black silk sky)</em> appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(pause)</em> She won’t be back.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> How—how can it be?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> She died three days ago. </p>
<p><em>(Silence falls, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(unbelievable)</em> You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. </p>
<p>​    <em>(Pause. They both look up to see the sign.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Of course. <em>(pause)</em> Mommy.</p>

        <p>Neal Shusterman once stated in Unwind Dystology Book 3 that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” (186) Contemporary people are starting to embrace various beauty standards. However, South Korean male stars seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups when appearing on public occasions, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. As a matter of fact, people are not concealing the emperor’s “masculine body” by claiming the presence of the “feminine clothes”—instead he is placed safe and sound in their “instinct zone” where the judgement of femininity is formed. In other words, the truth is not ignored—it only needs some thought to emerge. Back to reality, the fact is that people ought to be ready for a combat to eliminate the “blind spot” in order to rehabilitate K-pop male stars: they should not be cosmetically defined traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>Simply, if someone is trying to judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of “femininity”, check the word’s definition! It shows the limitation of convention. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nothing specific about cosmetics is set as the standard to tell genders apart. And what if something is changing after a “long time”? Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards i.e. milky skin and dyed hair, was almost drowned by audience’s saliva (Yi, David). Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to cater to the “2021 status quo”. What seems acceptable now was once against the tradition. Therefore, how did the Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition. It infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots (Yi, David). Cosmetics plausibly grow to be the pressure solver. Overall, the society is evolving so that what were viewed “out of style” are now “suitably” or “untraditionally” with the times. It is an innovation. Should the K-pop male stars be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the current version of definition which only focuses on the convention. </p>
<p>Time is going on. If the definition of femininity is restricted conventionally, then masculinity must step forward. In other words, the concept of soft masculinity appears because of the negation of traditional femininity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appearing in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, can be seen as a “flower boy” superficially, however he was also strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). This fully indicates the moral interpretation of machismo—bravery and decisiveness. It seems like only what their faces look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” owing to abdominals which are not counted in female beauty standards (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). Once again, only the cosmetic complexions are so controversial—other physical features are in the safety zone of masculinity. However, at the end of day, cosmetics can only <strong>soften</strong> facial features, with no relation to femininity because of what is beneath the skin with cosmetics.</p>
<p>To make a final statement, people see how the K-pop females look, then coming to a conclusion that males are imitating. The so-called “femininity trend” actually arises from the two genders sharing some similarities, thus the conviction for femininity is null. Take beauty standards as an example. Fair skin is required for both men and female (Yi, David). Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers from different genders while offering treatments that personify the same beauty standard (Cummings, Aaron). In this way, how to overturn the assumption of imitation? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% (Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs) of South Korean total population are foreigners (Foreign Population in Korea Tops 2.5 Million). Here comes an analogy: in children’s choirs composed of local kids only, boys and girls are always uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. First of all, facial features are in a likeness (no foreigners). Additionally, the makeups are the same. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully males “trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance instinctively which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since this means that they fail the equality between men and women. Standing at two genders’ intersection, K-pop males are still themselves—the kind of person they want to be, no matter soft or hard. At the same time, femininity is also evolving. No matter how, the tradition cannot be used on those boys definitely since they are the buds of the new age, blood-soaked, in exchange for hope.</p>

        <p>Neal Shusterman, the writer of <em>Unwind</em> series, once wrote that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot. intext citation” Nowadays(contemporary) people are starting to embrace distinct beauty standards. However, South Korean male idols seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups (on stage), which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. But in fact, people are not mean to conceal the emperor’s masculinity by claiming the presence of femininity—the feminine emperor is placed safely in their instinct. Back to reality, the truth is that someone ought to be ready for a combat to break/that breaks the instinct zone because K-pop male stars should not be cosmetically defined (not so sure) traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>The definition of “femininity” is definitely a credible source to help judge whether the K-pop male idols meet this standard. So be it? Doubtful. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman.”,(not sure) while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetical complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars.

Not at least in the traditional version of definition.</p>
<p>The redefinition of femininity gives a chance to the evolution of masculinity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appears in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, may be seen as a Khonminam (flower boy in Korean) superficially, however he is meanwhile strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service. This indicates the interpretation of masculinity—they behave as men. Only what they choose to look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” with abdominals which is not counted in female beauty standards. Cosmetics can only soften facial features—or, at deeper level, the masculine quality with no relation to femininity. </p>
<p>To make a final statement, the so-called “femininity trend” is actually due to the similar beauty standard between K-pop males and females. One of the biggest South Korean beauty standards is to have fair skin (other factors mainly focus on particular gender characteristics, e.g. small lovely noses for women.

        <p>Neal Shusterman, the writer of Unwind series, once wrote that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” Nowadays people start to embrace distinct beauty standards. However, male idols South Korea seems to burden much more controversy: renowned groups such as Big Bang, EXO, and BTS always wear heavy make-ups, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. But in fact, people are not mean to conceal the emperor’s masculinity by claiming the presence of femininity—the feminine emperor is placed safely in their instinct. Back to reality, the truth is that someone ought to be ready for a combat that breaks the instinct zone because K-pop male stars should not be cosmetically defined as feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p> The matching definitions are always the credible sources to help judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of femininity. So be it? Doubtful. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman.”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards e.g. milky skin and dyed hair, was drowned by audience’s saliva. Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to update the definition of femininity in aims of catering to the “2021 status quo”. So, how did the South Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition which also infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots. Cosmetics plausibly grew as the pressure solver. Overall, the society is progressing so that what were viewed “typically out of style” are now “suitably with the times”. So can the “flower boys” be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the traditional version of definition.</p>
<p> The redefinition of femininity gives a chance to the evolution of masculinity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appears in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, may be seen as a Khonminam (or flower boy) superficially, however he is meanwhile strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service. This indicates the interpretation of masculinity—they behave as men. Only what they choose to look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” with abdominals which is not counted in female beauty standards. Cosmetics can only soften facial features—or, at deeper level, the masculine quality with no relation to femininity. </p>
<p> To make a final statement, the so-called “femininity trend” is actually due to the similar beauty standard between K-pop males and females. One of the biggest South Korean beauty standards is to have fair skin (other factors mainly focus on particular gender characteristics, e.g. small lovely noses for women. Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers in different genders while offering treatments that interpretate/personify the same beauty standard. In this way, is it the males that are imitating the females? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously for her, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% of Korean total population are foreigners. Imagine that in a Korean chorus, boys and girls are uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics and also plastic surgeries apparently that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully the “male trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p> At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since that means that they fail the equality between men and women.</p>

        <p>List of characters:</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> A sly guy who plays a trick on Red Riding Hood in order to kill she and her grandma for food.</p>
<p><strong>WOODCUTTER.</strong> A gallant and righteous men who save RRD and grandma from the wolf.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—The forest:</strong></p>
<p><em>(setting: a thriving forest where the crystal blue sky and sunshine vanish. The air is moggy. The ground is covered with fallen dark green leaves. Despite a faint scent, the stench is still conspicuous if you get a sensitive nose. Some rotting dead bodies are lying behind the oak roots.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silently but notably, a wolf with hostile and sly eyes lets his head out behind the oak, watching Red Riding Hood bouncing cheerfully towards north)</em></p>
<p><strong>RED RIDING HOOD (RRH).</strong> How nice the flowers smell! (<em>Pause.</em>) Something also smells odd in the air…maybe just my illusion (<em>grin.</em>) After all mom’s rotten eggs are so smelly!</p>
<p>​    (<em>the wolf steps out.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> (<em>smirk.</em>) Hello! My dear! Such a nice day, uh? </p>
<p><strong>RRH.</strong> (<em>startled.</em>) Oh, it’s you, Mr. Wolf? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> Ha, free Sunday, nothing to do! What about you dear? Where are you heading for wearing such a cute hood? (<em>wink.</em>) I can get you accompanied…you know…in such a dangerous forest.</p>
<p>​    (<em>RRD tends to nod, but hesitate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(to the audience, whisper.)</em> My mom told me to be ignorant to the stranger.</p>
<p>​    <em>（**wolf seems to have the ability of telepathy.**）</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(put his arm around RRD’s shoulder.)</em> I know your concern dear. It’s really unsafe for you to walk in the dark forest with a stranger like me. Why not tell me your destination, and then I will figure out whether the main big road can lead you to it or not?</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(ponder, then nod.)</em> Sure, Mr. Wolf! <em>(suddenly joyful.)</em> So generous are you! Actually, I gonna visit my grandma who lives in a hut.</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(smirk, then pretend to laugh happily.)</em> Lucky you! The main road can definitely lead you there! So don’t risk your life in here anymore hon, go now! Bless you and the dear madam!</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(touched.)</em> Cannot be more thankful. I will bring your blessing to grandma! </p>
<p>​    <em>(RRD leaves cheerfully, disappearing in the forest soon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(to the audience.)</em> You know, I’ve been hungry for such a long time.</p>
<p>​    <em>(wolf heads for the north as the speed of light.)</em></p>
