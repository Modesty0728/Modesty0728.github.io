<p>Dear family,</p>
<pre><code> Umm…hi…</code></pre>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>​    I don’t know where to start, really, because you can never understand me due to thirteen years’ brainwashing. Ha, you may find it funny. How can it be brainwashing? Papa, mama, you are clever. You informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young thus naively believed everything you told. Gradually I locked my fabulous imagination, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”, “God creates us”, “God is worth sacrificing”. Maybe I should be thankful for you specially give me a sheltered structure to grow up? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are the direct precious of holy God! So, do you think my life is meaningful? Oh, my fault, you definitely are thinking in that way once I was born. You know, I also find this question tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind living without purpose is ridiculous and all that in my mind which make me turn him in is the “truth” you said to me: why not “contribute a voice to the world” instead of being so meaningless? But what’s your “holy” standard of “meaningless”? Uh, God, of course. Because of your damn ideas, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, you are the dimness covers my hearts on fire. I’m arrogant, cold, and not compassionate, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous right? Read on. After I escape from school, I realize how much I want to be alive! And how scary it is to face the possible death. In the past I’m not alone, since the “glorious solace” keeps me company. But now I’m alone. I’m separate myself from the identity of tithe, and I begin to fear. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. Now I find myself and my heart. I want to be alive, totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart, and everyone gets company. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawn continuously transport wood for burning, for all of you “saints” are amounts of water vapor leading to dimness, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, stepping away from my heart further and further until the fire is totally invisible. Now I think you do understand the difference between wood and water vapor.</p>
<p>​    Do you know how stifling my life is? I’m like a fish trapped beneath ice! But what else can I blames on you…You have been fiercely protective towards me as a tithe…is it only because of my identity or myself? I know…You choose to protect your faith…I wouldn’t choose myself either…after all I cannot be more frustrated than I feel now. Thirteen years’ brainwash…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living rather than any ridiculous destiny!</p>
<p>​    But… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces! Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I’m tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on you but will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become vapor ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful for this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved in front of death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t myself yet since I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so serious? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to find out who I am. Others are now meaningless to me. </p>
<p>After all, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                Your TREASURE,</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                          Lev Calder</p>

        <p>hi，Mrs. Smith！sorry for disturbing you at night,but I’m just too exciting to tell you something Recently I’m taking some courses about my future major,and my teacher is in Oxford University…You know,I’m really really introverted  and want to express so many things but just can’t help So you can’t imagine how thankful I am to you,to BCA! I talked to the teacher about dystopia and unwind, Macbeth and Shakespeare (I am reading his tales in advance).And when she mentioned Dickens,you can’t imagine how excited I was to shout out “Signalman!” What I found most challenging and makes me stressed out is the lady asked me to (pretend to)attend Oxford’s interview… but I did it and she said “well done”!You know why?It is because the close-reading interview in about to analyze a poem!She thought I might not know something like alliteration…and so surprisingly I shout out “Wow I know that !!! I also know it is written in narrative version or free verse…” Dear Mrs. Smith I suppose my major would definitely be related to comparative literature (I love English and Mandarin so much and want to be the connection between them)or education…no matter how,definitely about Arts. Before, I really doubted the necessity of learning these literacy knowledge,but now I know that that are exactly what I need for my major,for my future Because of what you’ve taught ,I can communicate with my teacher (maybe in the future my interviewer)so naturally and enthusiastically!!! The lady also mentioned that the interviewer cares more about your critical thinking and there’s no correct answer to any of the questions. That sounds so familiar…because you say that every time before class discussion!!! You are always my favorite teacher because you respect and mildly accept all my ideas… I think you are always helping me with my future invisibly… I can’t be more thankful… As aforementioned I am really shy [Lol]I force myself to raise my hand and that is the happiest thing I experienced in BCA! I’m too shy to show my emotions and I want you to know that I really really enjoy the novel unwind and can feel every single change of emotion of every character. Also for drama,so glad to learn soooo many new stuff helping me get out of comfort zone! I love everything you’ve taught…it’s just I’m scared to tell you because I think my poor English would bother you or makes you suffer…after all it must be very very hard to live abroad while facing so many poor English speakers all the day I really think you need to have more time relaxing so didn’t come to you… I also want to tell you another secret Initially I decided to go to A-level because I want to go to UK. But on the consulting day, our Chinese headmaster Mr.Zhang told me something, that made me change mind totally and chose a path I would never regret,that is: BCA is a real high school, with completed education system. IB and A-level are just only like after-school classes. So now you can understand how much I love BCA, love you…truly  (sorry for typing out so many thoughts … I do have loads of thoughts despite being so quite [Lol]</p>

        <p><strong>Part THREE:</strong></p>
<p>u Why does Hayden call the harvest camps “black holes”? Is the metaphor an appropriate one? (pg 80)</p>
<p>\1.  A black hole is a region of spacetime where nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. According to Hayden, no one knows what happens in the harvest camp only the final result of being unwound. In other words, no one exactly knows the process of unwinding and the treatments on unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.  The metaphor is quite appropriate because it clearly tells us how mysterious the harvest camp and the unwinding process is and also emphasizes that this unknown place is some kind of horrible, connecting to this novel’s writing topic—dystopia.</p>
<p>u Who is Humphrey Dunfree? Do you think his story is truth, fiction, or something in-between? (pgs 81-82)</p>
<p>\1.  He is the “survivor” of unwind order. Like other kids, Humphrey get what he “deserved” after his parents sign the order who however, going mad towards it. Then they hacked in to The National Unwind Database, getting to know each Humphrey’s single part’s new owners and secretly searching them to paying what they owed to Humphrey back in the way of rearrangement.</p>
<p>\2.  I think his story is something between truth and fiction. According to the previous context, a computer virus diminished Connor’s discussion towards Humphrey. I don’t think it is a coincidence or the government wouldn’t be so stressed out and furious. However, Humphrey’s story is also too uncanny to believe so I suppose some parts of it is made up by imagination or exaggeration, but it must be based on the real event. No matter the story is one-hundred percent realistic or not, it’s quite sure that in this mad world parents’ guilty emotions exist and there are some crazy actions to take trying to turn the unwound result into reversible. It clearly shows the fragility of human nature and people are struggling against the dystopia.</p>
<p>u Why does Sonia have the Unwinds write letters home? What does Connor learn from his letter writing experience? (pg 85)</p>
<p>\1.  Sonia wants the unwinds to write down everything not being said before to someone they love. And the letters will be sent once they reached eighteen. </p>
<p>(a. For the unwinds, </p>
<p>is a good chance for releasing themselves from the miserable memories. Writing letters also helps them recognize themselves’ true attitudes towards everything, including family, unwind order, and the crazy world. No matter what would happen in the next, at least the unwinds take up the responsibility of speaking up for themselves and the people who are suffering in dystopia. The unwinds have already <strong>made a contribution</strong> on behalf of themselves to the world. Sonia makes the unwinds’ “useless” life meaningful. </p>
<p>Self-writing also helps them relieved with no regret left. </p>
<p>(b. For their guardians,</p>
<p>No matter their kids would survive or not, the guardians would receive the letter on the unwinds’ eighteenth birthday. Sonia chooses this special day for certain reasons. It is like the guardians push their kids into water without looking back, and one day they see the same pool however with no water and simultaneously are sent a previous video about how the stifling kids were struggling beneath water without knowing whether the poor kids survive or not. When guardians receive letter, there are not danger for the unwinds anymore. However, the easeful status-quo would definitely get them realized how gloomy the hell that they have put kids into is. As aforementioned, it’s just like watching kids suffering from over head water when there’s no water remains anymore. <strong>Objectively</strong>, Sonia aims to get the guardians at least been aware of how miserable the kids are under the unwind order. And <strong>subjectively</strong>, she wants the guardians to respect their kids’ thoughts by reading letters and reflect on themselves about their recognition towards human nature. By letting the guardians know the unwinds better, there’s a slight hope that they may <strong>also contribute a voice</strong> to the world by changing the attitude towards “unwind” to gradually make less kids suffer. After all, they the ones who decide life and death to some extent.</p>
<p>\2.  From the writing experience, Connor recognizes many things. </p>
<p>(a. Firstly, He doesn’t truly love Ariana because she is not the one offering hope and strength now, and that’s why Connor thinks writing to Ariana is pointless. </p>
<p>(b. Deep down in Connor’s heart, he still loves his parents. Connor’s sweet memories towards his family seem to be blocked once the unwind order is found. Everything his family do next is shaded with darkness which looks so hopeless that Connor’s heart begins to be full of it, which numbs his mind and makes him feel like all the memories is in darkness now. In other words, it is proved to be an illusion and the precious deep love Connor’s parents offered is still too strong and impressed to forget. That’s why Connor finds himself still love them, as a spontaneous respond to their love.</p>
<p>u What is the analogy Risa makes between Connor and the teacher/Hannah? How does Connor respond to the question of “Do you want it?” (pg 88)</p>
<p>\1.  Hannah is willing to take the baby, however Connor asks whether Hannah wants the baby, and then Risa wants Connor’s answer towards the question if it is set for him.</p>
<p>\2.  Connor hesitates for a while and goes on the truck after emphasizing the baby’s gender—female. Deep down Connors knows that Hannah and him is the same. They don’t want the baby, but are willing to take it and protect it from danger. Now Connor has finished his responsibility and willingness of take care about the baby to be less guilty towards previous experience. He knows he has done his best to save her, and that’s enough.</p>
<p>u What’s the difference between a run-away and a run-to? Why do you think CyFi is a run-to? (pg 92)</p>
<p>\1.  A run-to has a destination is his/her mind, which is the main difference compared with a run-away. Run-aways and run-toes are all escaping from the terrible unwind order, however the latter has a more explicit plan.</p>
<p>\2.  We all know that in the previous context, Risa, Connor and Lev are exactly three run-aways who are always nervous and wary to deal with occasional emergencies. CyFi is completely different because he is quite relaxed walking along railway and knows exactly where he is going to although he cannot tell.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev feel like he’s an accomplice to murder? Why is this word choice and connotation significant? (pg 94)</p>
<p>\1.  Because Risa and Connor now are probably and caught and then unwound, which is all lev’s fault. Lev turned the two “kidnappers” in so he feels ashamed to push them to the end of their life.</p>
<p>\2.  (a. Firstly this word shows Connor’s point of view is changing.</p>
<p>(c. This word is thought-provoking. It makes us think about the nature of unwinding again. Is it murdering or not? This word not only fosters lev to think deeply ignoring his family’s ideas, but also allows readers to have their own speculations because there’s no exact answer.</p>
<p>u How is CyFi’s experience with Unwind parts different from everyone else we’ve read about so far? How do you think this could cause problems? (pgs 95-96)</p>
<p>\1.  CyFi was hit when riding a hike so his right temporal lobe is widely damaged. However, instead of getting body parts or bits e.g. an arm, CyFi got an entire temporal lobe during the surgeon.</p>
<p>\2.  Scattered body parts may have some body memories, but are individual and weak. But an entire temporal lobe means part of the entire nerve system, and individual tissues are connecting into each other. That means CyFi got a real strong and independent lobe which can influence and even control him sometimes.</p>
<p>u What does Lev realize on page 99? How is this significant for his character?</p>
<p>\1.  Lev realizes that CyFi is acting weirdly. There’s something in his eyes and voice. CyFi is now lagging behind Lev and looks like a shuffle, which indicates that he is quite nervous or stressful. The way of his talking is also converted from Old Umber into menacing.</p>
<p>\2.  This shows that Lev is wary and observant.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Lev realizes that his parents love God more than loving him and he hates them for it. His parents always do what supposed to do but are too crazy about their faith to deeply love someone in the real life like Lev. <strong>Recognize the fact</strong></p>
<p>\2.  Lev’s recognition might be a turning point for his character. Before Pastor Dan told him to run away, he is brainwashed by the idea of the high God by his family. Lev then runs away just trying to be alone and reset thoughts. Through the calm and deep thinking after escaping from school, he finally finds out his hidden hatred to the cold love of family and is more empathetic than he used to be when being brainwashed. Lev’s recognition also demonstrates his beginning point of re-recognizing himself. To some extent, the change of Lev is also implying he would meet Risa and Connor again in the future, and at that time they all of the three are aiming to survive from unwind order along with the disappointment this world, based on which the author is trying to show how crazy dystopia is. <strong>Recognize himself</strong></p>
<p>u Who stole the Christmas ornament? What does this tell us about Unwinding? (pg 102)</p>
<p>\1.  The boy who lives as one-eighth CyFi’s brain stole the Christmas ornament. He controlled CyFi himself and acted like what he did before getting unwound.</p>
<p>\2.  This tells the readers more about unwinding. Unwinding indeed has the potential danger to the one who got the body parts because the organs are not theirs technically. The potential danger is threatening, since people who benefit from unwinding can be mess up. More importantly, the potential danger makes unwinding a more negative thing, since it ruins the life of both kids under order and people who “get help”.</p>
<p>u Why is CyFi taking Lev to Joplin, Missouri? (pg 106)</p>
<p>Because the boy who lives as a part of CyFi wants to get there. CyFi is bothered by his thoughts from times to time and wants to <strong>get rid of</strong> them. Anyway, no one wants to be controlled by others’ perspectives, but CyFi is also going there to <strong>help</strong> the boy because he finds the boy pathetic and hurting. So CyFi is actually kind deep down.</p>
<p>u What rumor/story is starting to spread in the warehouse? How could this be the beginning of a symbol? (pg 108)</p>
<p>\1.  The rumor is about a Akron AWOL escaping from a Juvey-cop  whose tranquilizer pistol is seized and getting himself down. This big boeuf superhero may be on the way to the warehouse.</p>
<p>\2.  This rumor or story shows the unwinds admire Connor’s courage and achievements, which would definitely be the beginning of the symbol of Roland’s hostility towards him.</p>
<p>u How does Risa’s opinion of Connor change after the incident with Roland in the bathroom? Is she seeing him differently than she did before? (pgs 114-116)</p>
<p>Risa’s opinion towards Connor actually changes. Before the incident she found Connor too impulsive to respond to Roland wisely. However, Connor controlled himself perfectly in the bathroom with no anger fled out. Although Risa is still blaming Connor for not saving him directly, but she must have found out that Connor behaved much better than she had expected. I believe Connor is more admirable to Risa from now on. Also, Risa realizes her true attitude towards Connor at that time—this boy is a hero, although she may not like him for so many troubles he has caused. Risa obviously appreciates Connor’s conscience and calmness now. Long before, it was just of being annoyed and normal cooperating.</p>

        <p>Some of my peers are really annoying and I’m feeling down because of them for so many times after being in the BCA family. They are working far less hard than me while still being condescending in front of me. Sometimes they asked me to answer their doubts and I felt like I was the one being taught and I was so humble! Today, Soda even said, “You are so relaxed since you are sleeping at noon”. That really hurts me because I consider her as my friend, and I do care about how others think about me. But I tell myself that the life will punish the ones who fail your kindness, and your hard work doesn’t need to be recognized by them (only by your heart is enough). In the future, when I’m in the university or society, there will be more annoying people, so now what I can do is to consider all the unhappiness as a preparation towards the cruel society. Yeah, thank you Soda for appearing in my life, making me stronger and stronger. And, good luck, in a perfect future with no one bearing you. By the way, thanks for providing me an antagonist for my novel! Plenty of precious resources!</p>

        <p>Today, my school life is filled and even more enjoyable than last week! During the first period, I participated in <em>unwind</em> ‘s part 2 discussions actively and happily got the answer to the confused question (Lev’s running away is due to confused emotion or the change of attitude towards getting unwound). For the last indoor PE class, I find myself have learnt so many about how to deal with mental issues and STIs. Chinese Chemistry really helps improve Science’s current learning and although I didn’t get perfect in the naming quiz, the small mistake reminds me of the insufficient learning towards Bohr Diagram and the whole particle unit. I’m not as miserable as I used to be, and I believe what I’ve actually covered would definitely help in the future tests. Science is easy and cheerful to learn as usual. I’m so glad to learn how to project rather than yelling in Drama class, and my little entertaining performance really surprised myself. So I’m more open that I supposed! I really enjoy drama and believe I can improve much more in the following few months.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I thought it is a bad thing that there are not pictures in the newspaper of the AWOLs because Risa and Connor are probably in the danger of being killed. However, based on my peers, I now realize that it can also be good since no report makes it easier for three of them to escape and hide. And the reason there are not reports can also be something outside the context which is referred from. Maybe the cops just don’t want to screw up their reputation and then cause consuming anxiety for citizens since they let three teenage unwinds escape in front of them.</p>
<p>And for the reason why Lev has such a mixed feeling on the bus to school is that He still wants Risa and Connor get unwound rather than being killed, which is kind of a ridiculous thought to us.</p>
<p>Connor’s attitude towards the storked baby is mentioned for many times, and Connor sees the irony and considers it ridiculous, so does not want it happens again. Although he is very kind to save the baby, it is still not a smart thing to do when facing the danger of getting unwound.</p>
<p>For Pastor Dan, we argued about whether he has betrayed or not. And eventually, the fact is, the concepts contradicting with each other in his heart is his responsibility as a Pastor and something really in his heart.</p>
<p>I asked about a question in class, which is the reason for Lev going away rather than going to the cops after the alarm is pulled. It is because he now does not want to get unwound anymore or he is confused and overwhelmed and just want to be alone and calm down? Mrs. Smith told us she would choose the latter. </p>
<p>There’s something I didn’t consider about the impact of the teacher. Mrs. Smith clarified that author’s intension is to reflect the real dystopia society: there are people just like the teacher who also think  “unwind” is wrong but they cannot do anything.</p>
<p>The antique shop where Risa and Connor goes to is actually a reference to the underground railway in the 19th century which is used to hide black people and transport them to the North.</p>
<p>When Sonia suggests Risa to get pregnant again, Risa is surprised while Connor feels awkward.</p>
<p>The big kid, Roland, he’s anger is probably comes from this stepfather’s violence towards his mother. He is hostile, which is similar to Connor to some extent and that’s why he supposes that Connor is threat to his leadership. Shark represents “strong”, “powerful”, so Roland wants to show dominant through the tattoo (may because of his stepfather’s dominant). And the amazing experiences of the three unwinds hidden underneath Sonia’s trapdoor can show how crazy this world or dystopia is.</p>

        <p><strong>Part TWO:</strong></p>
<p>u Why aren’t there pictures in the newspaper of the AWOLs? Is this a good or bad thing? (pages 43-44)</p>
<p> \1.  The signal of “no pictures” shows that the cops do not have the usual intension of tracking them and then taking them to get unwound anymore. This time the cops are definitely facing a special case in which they probably want to end up the three AWOLs’ life or kill the two kidnappers, following the order of Lev’s rich family.</p>
<p>\2.  This is definitely a bad thing because at least Risa and Connor now are facing a much scarier destiny of being killed rather than just getting unwound.</p>
<p>u What are Connor’s three emergency modes? Which one does he use on page 47?</p>
<p>\1.   What is different from Connor and others is that he always has one more emergency codes compared to the common ones namely “Fight” and “Flight”, which is “Screw Up Royally”. </p>
<p>\2.   What he uses on page 47 is the particular one: “Screw Up Royally”. In the context, it is explained as “a dangerous mental short circuit” and Connor’s previous short circuit of saving Lev is mentioned before introducing his current action towards the storked family. The author aims to clarify the same feeling of “the brain starts to fry” to show that Connor is using the same mode again.</p>
<p>u What happens to Lev on page 52? Why are his feelings so conflicted?</p>
<p>\1.   Lev moves one seat forwards to put more distance between he and the two “kidnappers”. He then reaches into the backpack of a boy absorbed into music sitting next to him, pulling out a notebook and pen, writing down the “distress signal” of being kidnapped. However, the boy is furious towards Lev’s using his stationary without asking therefore ignores what Lev is suggesting and rips out the page without looking at it.</p>
<p>\2.   lev thinks Risa and Connor still needs to follow the justice of being unwound to make themselves in different parts more meaningful. However, there is something in the darker recesses of his unconscious that is upsetting him. He don’t want them get killed and Lev knows the two “kidnappers” are not a danger to himself anymore.</p>
<p>u Why does Connor take the Storked baby? What does this tell us about his character?</p>
<p>\1.   Because he has seen a storked baby twice on his own doorstep, which is a same situation compared with what is currently happening. That may reminds Connor of the guilty feeling of remaining hands-off and stimulate his empathy.</p>
<p>\2.   This indicates that Connor is empathetic and soft deep down. He couldn’t bear the pain of watching new-borns dying and I admire his spirit of doing boldly what is righteous.</p>
<p>u Did Pastor Dan betray Levi? Why or why not? What situation is Lev in now? (pages 60-62)</p>
<p>\1.   It depends.</p>
<p>\2.   For Lev, Pastor Dan betrays him totally. In the past years, Pastor Dan acts just like his family, brainwashing Lev with the high idea of tithe. But now, just as Lev thinks, “led him to a cliff only to turn away at the last moment”, Pastor Dan forces Lev to convert his thoughts into brand new ones which is completely unknown to Lev. However, “betray” means to ignore your principles or beliefs in order to achieve sth or gain an advantage for yourself. Maybe Pastor Dan has never betrayed his faith. For Pastor Dan, everything all happens in a sudden that he may not have the chance to explain something that is hidden.</p>
<p>\3.   Lev is now dealing with a mixed feeling composed of happy, scared and confused. He has made the mistake which diminishes Connor and Risa’s trust towards him meanwhile deciding to face the unknown self and make up for what he has done.</p>
<p>u Why do you think the teacher helps the Unwinds, even though she knows helping them is a federal crime? (pages 63-64)</p>
<p>\1.   Because the teacher is experienced. She knows “how often compassion takes a back seat to expediency” and “kids only have this kind of desperation in their eyes when they’re going to be unwound. The teacher has seen so many miserable tragedies so she is quite empathetic. She once had the thought of these two “put myself and the school at risk”, but then understand what Connor is saying: “please be a human being”, because deep down the teacher approves that she ought to save living-beings from death.</p>
<p>u Where does the teacher take the Unwinds? What kind of place is it?</p>
<p>\1.   She leads the unwinds to the exist however Risa and Connor are recognized and followed by cops. They then create a great mess, pretending to be clappers and in the boiling crowd the teacher points the way to antique shop on Fleming Street and someone called Sonia.</p>
<p>\2.   The antique shop is in an older part of town and is quite old, with only one consumer and plenty of odd antiques.</p>
<p>u What does Sonia recommend Risa do to stay safe? How do Risa and Connor react? (page 74)</p>
<p>\1.   Sonia recommends Risa to have Connor get her pregnant “again” to stay safe because an expectant mother will not be unwound and Risa will then be bought nine whole months.</p>
<p>\2.   Both of them feel embarrassed and are silently against this idea. Risa is even annoyed by Sonia’s behaviors.</p>
<p>u What three other Unwinds do they meet? Why are they being unwound?</p>
<p>\1.   The three other unwinds are not moving and look exhausted and wary. </p>
<p>\2.   The smirker, Hayden comes from a ridiculously wealthy family however his parents got divorce and the brutal battle over him could not be resolved after two years. In the end his parents preferred getting Hayden unwound to allowing the other to have custody. </p>
<p>\3.   The Asian girl with pink hair is Mai. As the fourth girl in her family, she is nothing to them compared with the new-born son.</p>
<p>\4.   The big kid with a shark tattoo is Roland. He is being unwound because Roland beat up his stepfather for beating him mom who unexpectedly chose her husband’s side.</p>
<p>u Who is Roland? What tattoo does he have on his arm? What kind of person is he?</p>
<p>\1.   Roland is a muscular guy hidden behind Sonia’s trapdoor with other two unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.   He has a shark tattoo on his arm which looks scary.</p>
<p>\3.   Roland is ambitious, aggressive and suspicious. He has a dream of being a military boeuf and is strong enough to fight against his stepfather. He is probably the least friendly unwind among the three for his looks at Connor with intense distrust when they first meet.</p>

        <p>Recently I’m so surprised to find myself truly begin to enjoy the study life in BCA. Before, every day was just too tired since I’m comparing with others all the time and are commonly anxious. But now, I think I’ve relatively stopped myself from constant comparing through forcing myself to ignore others, and that effectively works. More importantly, I now find everything useful which can benefit and application to a great extent. I’d like to do the comparative literacy in the future meanwhile I actively put much more concentration on my Mandarin classes. All the ancient works-<em>Qian Zi Wen</em> and poems from Li Bai, are so enjoyable that I feel like when myself know my true purpose exactly and truly want to achieve it, I would try my best towards it happily. Also for the BC courses, I may have been underestimated Drama. I had no idea that this course is so useful, which surprises me a lot indeed. I thought it was just about acting and being confident, however it also offers so many skills which can improve my spoken English and presentation behaviors. First of all, we learnt how to breathe properly which can increase lung capacity and improve the property of our speaking. Mrs. Smith offered us a meditation time, and all of us began to being focus on breathing following the arranged pace. Then she plays a safe and sound music and starts telling soft and comforting words slowly. I remembered this one, which touched me a lot: it doesn’t matter if you play video games or watch movies. As long as you are happy, everything would be perfectly enough. It’s true one day we must face the cruel society with no sympathy, but BCA is always our home which eternally covers and loves us kids. And these two days we are studying the six vocal skills, namely enunciation, projection, pace, tone, emphasis, pitch. That is exactly I want and how helpful and great this course is! Sometimes it is difficult for me to pronounce clearly, and Mrs. Smith tell us helpful tricks like eliminating “g” and practicing pronunciation in front of a mirror while watching how our mouths acting. I believe that would definitely help me improve spoken English. </p>
<p>The happiest thing for this period is that I gradually achieve the goal which seemed impossible and hopeless before: enjoy all I’m studying.</p>

        <p>In the part 1 quiz, there was a question asked about “why does Connor initially grab lev on the highway?”. And the answer for that turned to be “He wants to have a hostage.” rather than “He wants to use him as a shield from the bullets.” However, my initial answer ought to be Connor’s later purpose. So in order to avoid bullets and being arrest, when Connor saw Lev by accident, he decides to have a hostage. I think it is difficult to choose the right one according to the last paragraph, but Connor was initially running by just grabbing Lev rather than using him as a shield. Also, Lev initially thought that “he wants a hostage.” So the writer may be is implying Connor’s intension in the last paragraph. But still I think both sides can be argued since the cops are shooting tranquilizer bullets before Connor grabbed Lev so considering Lev as a shield initially can also be rational.</p>
