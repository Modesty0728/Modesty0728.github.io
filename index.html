        <p><strong>Part FOUR:</strong></p>
<p>u Why do you think Lev tells the pawnshop owner that he is an unwind and that the bracelet is stolen? Why tell the truth?</p>
<p>\1.  Because the pawnshop owner said that he will never deal with minors so if Lev cannot show a special identity, his hope for getting 500 dollars would be ruined.</p>
<p>\2.  Pastor Dan and his family were brainwashing him with the faith of God. And something good about this is that Lev is righteous and will not tell a lie.</p>
<p>\3.  Also, Lev is not afraid of demonstrating the identity of unwind, because he uses the high price of bracelet to threaten the greedy pawnshop owner.</p>
<p>u How does Connor escape being put in the crate with Roland?</p>
<p>\1.  First of all, Connor tries his best to hide his panic to stay calm. If he behaves weak and soft, Connor would definitely be “controlled” by Roland completely. Without the courage of changing situation right away, Connor would be teased by Roland and suffer from much more Roland’s violence.</p>
<p>\2.  Next, he creates a chaos wisely. Connor punches one of Roland’s henchmen, which nearly breaks that boy’s nose. Spontaneously, the Fatigues pulls Connor out of crowd to give him a warning and avoid another fighting. In this way, Connor is arranged into another crate naturally. </p>
<p>u Some very intense conversations take place inside the crate. For the first time we are able to see how the Unwinds truly feel without all the bravado that normally comes with them. Why are these conversations important for the reader to see?</p>
<p>\1.  Sometimes we only know about “how cruel unwinding teenagers is” “the teenagers don’t want to get unwound”, but it’s difficult for us to think deeper into this dystopian world because we are out of the book. But the unwinds, and their conversations are empathetic and sincere. From their conversations, we can be more empathetic towards the theme of this book and know this world better because the teenagers’ words are always true and transparent.</p>
<p>\2.  The unwinds are talking about individual reasons for unwinding. That completely reflects the dark side of human nature.</p>
<p>\3.  The context can also get people think more towards some philosophical topics like soul, and law.</p>
<p>\4.  The context shows a group of kids struggle to live and think under the gloomy unwind order. I think the author doesn’t choose a side. He just wants to show the most real world: everyone is thinking and thinking, trying to figure out the truth, then moving on and try their best to lead a nice life with diverse opinions towards the world.</p>
<p>u What is your first impression upon meeting the Admiral? Why? Explain. </p>
<p>\1.  I think the Admiral the amiable and enthusiastic—he welcomes the kids to come to graveyard as soon as they meet each other in the airport.</p>
<p>\2.  The admiral is quite professional according to his appearance—full of scars and doesn’t appear to sweat even in hot uniform.</p>
<p>\3.  The Admiral is someone who gets accumulated stories and experiences. Risa mentioned that his uniform is from the war between pro-life and pro-choice forces. But now, he chooses to protect the unwinds, who are derived from the war he attended in. That would be quite interesting to notice.</p>
<p>\4.  He is also quite responsible since he says “No one gets unwound on my watch.” and sets up an independent civilization system.</p>
<p>u What do you think the point of Cy mentioning the poster he saw about a salmon?</p>
<p>I think it is a foreshadow which anticipates the coming event. As aforementioned, Lev compares Cy to a salmon swimming upstream to get to the destination. So, the poster may be implying the coming trouble Cy is going to face—facing the cops.</p>
<p>u How do you feel reading chapter 30? Explain. </p>
<p>\1.  I actually feel gloomy after reading chapter 30. Clearly, when someone gets unwound, his or her brain keeps the previous memories and remains unchanged. In the context, Tyler carries his miserable pleading until being unwound. And for Tyler’s parents, it must be quite astonished and guilty when facing their son plead again after their last look towards each other. It may feel like facing the ghost of someone you killed. </p>
<p>\2. it is also heart-rending because I can feel how miserable and hysterical Tyler was.</p>
<p>u Why do you think Lev gets so upset at Tyler’s parents?</p>
<p>\1.  Tyler’s parents are comforting each other instead of comforting or responding to lev, which makes Lev furious.</p>
<p>\2.  He cannot bear to see Cy so miserable and hysterical. </p>
<p>\3.  Deep down, Lev is furious of his own parents because they also ignore Lev’s opinions when he is struggling and may want to lead his own life. This emotion is stimulated by what happens on Cy and is the resentment is transferred to Tyler’s parents.</p>
<p>u Lev says that he’s been, “changed by this moment, transformed in some deep and frightening way.” Why do you think he says that?</p>
<p>Before Lev thought unwinding is honorable and looked down to those kids who are scared to get unwound. But now Lev eventually realizes how miserable and hysterical an unwind can be in his or her limited lifetime. He is also disappointed towards those exclusive and distant people who show no sympathy to unwinds. Lev now sees a more real and cruel world than before, and all the negative information is against his justice, which makes him suffer. His good imagination towards this world vanishes and hatred takes its place.</p>

<p>Dear family,</p>
<p>​    Umm…hi…</p>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is pointless right? As you always told me: “high God love you much more than we do.”</p>
<p>​    Don’t know where to start. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage was blocked by myself and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. MAYBE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR YOU GAVE ME A SPECIAL SHELTERED STRUCTURE TO GROW UP? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous but familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: “You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter?” I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: “how can you say that?” “The pig is nothing, but you are the treasure of holy God!” “Gosh how could you…” My fault, you have definitely been thinking in that way since I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind that living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn faith, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, YOU ARE LIKE THE DIMNESS OF FIRE! I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. </p>
<p>You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from the school, I realized how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however I am now, indeed, when separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I just want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with overheated soul and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because the care from you “saints” are just water vapor that forms DIMNESS, so heavy, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you kept me company but what you would never realize is that the more you accompany (actually brainwash) me, the more I get to suffer, and MY SOUL ON FIRE AND LIGHT is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different functions of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water!!! But what else can I blame on you…You were fiercely protecting me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either—after all I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living, rather than some ludicrous mission!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I had my entire body on your hand whereas would never be noticed and then gone by the wind…uh then became “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>​    Besides, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>

        <p>​    My junior high classmates define me as a girl who is “boy-proof”. “I don’t want to be her desk-mate because she is so dour!” “I don’t know her…wait a minute, Uh I see… She is the one never talks.” “You know, my friend Modesty, she never talks to a boy!” </p>
<pre><code> I’m born introverted but don’t want to embarrass others. Therefore, I feel so ashamed to them that I force myself to speak out, to take the first step, to change. But nothing changes and I define myself a waste of space. I feel as if everyone are trying their best to attack the injury that I struggle to hide…and they succeed. 

 One day, I’m talking to a psychologist casually about the “defect” and family. Simultaneously she has tears falling down, and I’m totally confused. She takes my hand, whispering: “My girl, your ‘defect’ only derives from your father’s frequent absence…that’s why you don’t know how to get along with boys.” At that moment, I’m relieved, but then heartbroken. So, I haven’t done anything wrong but only my plush toys know how many hours I’ve been crying. I really want to hug my earlier self and tell her “It’s okay.” But I won’t be inclined to self-pity anymore, because what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger. No one can define you. No one can decide who you are. So be yourself rather than being humble towards worthless people, whose “malice” is only ashes for a strong girl.</code></pre>

<p>Dear family,</p>
<p>​    Umm…hi…</p>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>​    Don’t know where to start. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually I blocked my fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. MAYBE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR YOU GAVE ME A SPECIAL SHELTERED STRUCTURE TO GROW UP? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are nearest to holy God! Gosh how could you…My fault, you have definitely been thinking in that way since I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn faith, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, YOU ARE ALWAYS THE DIMNESS OF FIRE! I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from cops I called, I realize how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however now I am, indeed, separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because care from you “saints” are just water vapor forming THE DIMNESS, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (actually brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, and MY SOUL ON FIRE is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different function of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water! But what else can I blames on you…You were fiercely protective towards me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either…I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living, rather than some ludicrous mission!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on your hand whereas will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>Besides, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>

        <p>Today I watched a recent Disney film <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>. That really really touches me. Firstly, its theme, about trust, is very original. Moreover, it makes me recall my own experience: I was also hurt so many times and dare not to trust anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we are hurt by someone we trust. The feeling of being betrayed if like the burning of heart. Just like Raya’s father, Sisu, and Raya herself. I quite understand that the feeling is strong and stifling enough to destroy someone’s fantasy forever, and what is most difficult is to offer another chance to build the bridge of trust. Step first, and you will gain something out of imagination.</p>
<p>Even if you are hurt by this world from head to toes, please still hold your kindness, because the world would always reward you.</p>

        <p>Have you ever been defined as some kind of person you don’t like? I do. You know, I’m born introverted but don’t want to make others uncomfortable.</p>
<p> <strong>I feel like a fish struggling beneath The Arctic Ocean, envious about strong waves breaking up ice.</strong> My junior high classmates define me as a girl who is “boy-proof”. Everyone, even some of my good friends, joking about this from time to time. “I don’t want to be her desk-mate because she is so dour!” “I don’t know her…wait a minute, Uh I see… She is the one never talks.” “You know, my friend Modesty, she never talks to a boy!” Now it seems waves are teasing me while drawing me into a huge vortex they formed. The darkness intensifies my fear towards myself, making it tougher to break the icy layer. I feel so sorry to them that I try to use my miserableness to exchange their awkwardness and force myself to speak out, to change. But nothing happens and I define myself a waste of space. All of them are trying their best attacking the injury that I struggle to hide…and they succeed. Time gradually washes memories away, and I’m so cheerful to graduate. Entering a brand-new environment, I feel so great to define myself again. And one day, I casually talks to a psychologist who is a friend of my family’s about my “hidden defect”. Simultaneously she has tears falling down, and I’m totally confused. She takes my hand, with tears in eyes, whispering: “My girl, the only reason that gets you a ‘defect’, is the lack of your father’s company. That’s why you don’t know how to get along with boys.” At that moment, I’m relieved, but then heartbroken. So I haven’t done anything wrong but only my plush toys know how miserable I am. I really want to hug that little girl and tell her “It’s okay.” But I don’t want to end up this now. I won’t be inclined to self-pity anymore, because no one can define me, no one can decide who I am anymore. I will always believe in myself rather than being humble towards worthless people. What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger. Next time, please watch your tongue, because your rumors are ridiculous in front of a strong girl.</p>

<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on your hand whereas will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>After all, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>

<p>Dear family,</p>
<pre><code> Umm…hi…</code></pre>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>​    I don’t know where to start, really, because you can never understand me due to thirteen years’ brainwashing. Ha, you may find it funny. How can it be brainwashing? Papa, mama, you are clever. You informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young thus naively believed everything you told. Gradually I locked my fabulous imagination, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”, “God creates us”, “God is worth sacrificing”. Maybe I should be thankful for you specially give me a sheltered structure to grow up? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are the direct precious of holy God! So, do you think my life is meaningful? Oh, my fault, you definitely are thinking in that way once I was born. You know, I also find this question tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind living without purpose is ridiculous and all that in my mind which make me turn him in is the “truth” you said to me: why not “contribute a voice to the world” instead of being so meaningless? But what’s your “holy” standard of “meaningless”? Uh, God, of course. Because of your damn ideas, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, you are the dimness covers my hearts on fire. I’m arrogant, cold, and not compassionate, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous right? Read on. After I escape from school, I realize how much I want to be alive! And how scary it is to face the possible death. In the past I’m not alone, since the “glorious solace” keeps me company. But now I’m alone. I’m separate myself from the identity of tithe, and I begin to fear. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. Now I find myself and my heart. I want to be alive, totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart, and everyone gets company. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawn continuously transport wood for burning, for all of you “saints” are amounts of water vapor leading to dimness, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, stepping away from my heart further and further until the fire is totally invisible. Now I think you do understand the difference between wood and water vapor.</p>
<p>​    Do you know how stifling my life is? I’m like a fish trapped beneath ice! But what else can I blames on you…You have been fiercely protective towards me as a tithe…is it only because of my identity or myself? I know…You choose to protect your faith…I wouldn’t choose myself either…after all I cannot be more frustrated than I feel now. Thirteen years’ brainwash…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living rather than any ridiculous destiny!</p>
<p>​    But… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces! Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I’m tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on you but will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become vapor ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful for this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved in front of death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t myself yet since I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so serious? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to find out who I am. Others are now meaningless to me. </p>
<p>After all, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>
