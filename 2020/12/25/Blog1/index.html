        <p>“Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Mommy! Of course. Take care!”</p>
<p>The woman was waving at her daughter, watching the train leave the station. A clammy wind blew up, freezing me up instantly. I lay on the bench, envious and lonely. Two months ago, my parents were dead in a big fire. This happened so rapidly that the abrupt pain worked like alcohol, numbing my nerves. No relatives and property were left except a few clothes. The train station was considered as my temporary shelter. I began to beg for food two weeks ago, however giving it up because of burnout. Currently, I was thinking about how to get over the starvation as I would never give up my life facilely. There were bound to be some methods of getting food money without begging.</p>
<p>I had a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>No, it was vicious, definitely.</p>
<p>For the next hour, World War III broke out in my brain. The crazy idea came into my mind time after time, frustrating me. It was a moral violation! Mom always said I was a virtuous girl. Her words lingered in my ears, a long time cannot be dispersed. But nothing was left for me now, besides I would return it back in the end… Then I took out my cellphone slowly.</p>
<p>I was sorry, nonetheless I wanted to survive.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I dialed a casual number.</p>
<p>“Du…”my cellphone began to warn like an alarm. My heart beat violently, as if all the surroundings were staring at me, preparing to expose my crime.</p>
<p>A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>That voice must be a lady’s.</p>
<p>“Umm, I—”<br> “Hang on a second. I told you I cannot afford these cosmetics! Please get out .”</p>
<p>I stopped immediately. How could I cheat the poor lady for money? But before I hang up the phone, she continued—</p>
<p>“Forgive me, sometimes salesmen can be extremely annoying you know. So, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Umm, madam,” I whispered, “Your child is my friend—”</p>
<p>“You mean Hyacinth?”</p>
<p>“S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Hyacinth, you definitely know that! What a perfect name! In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…”</p>
<p> “Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and—is she at home now?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the lady fell silent. </p>
<p>“No. She is not here.”</p>
<p> “Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help!” I had tried my best to shout out anxiously and was just about to explain the trouble more specifically, to my surprise, the lady replied without doubting.</p>
<p> “She needs money, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” I mustered the courage to make myself sound steadfast.</p>
<p>Another silence seemed like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.</p>
<p>“I will definitely give enough money to people in need.”</p>
<p>“I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter!” Despite I am the person in need coincidently, I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>“You know,” suddenly said the lady, “You must be a girl with a kind heart, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.”</p>
<p>“Not really…”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.”</p>
<p>I felt a familiar warmth inside, so real that nearly made me cry out.</p>
<p>“It’s just a duty to care about minors.”</p>
<p>My nose stung. Tears stood in my dull eyes.</p>
<p>“If you accept, let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.”</p>
<p>I could not control my feeling anymore. All the lies crumbled—</p>
<p>“Madam! I’m sorry. What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be alive! You are the only person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.” </p>
<p>“My dear child,” The lady chuckled, “This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the ‘wicked’ idea has been defeated by your conscience.”</p>
<p>Her words melted my ice-cold heart. In place of tears, there was the beginning of a smile. “I… appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?”</p>
<p>“She won’t be back.”</p>
<p>“How—how can it be?”</p>
<p>“She died three days ago.” </p>
<p>Another silence, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p>“My condolences.”</p>
<p>“That’s ok.”</p>
<p>“You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.”</p>
<p>I could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Mommy.”</p>
<p>Psalm 25 says, “Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.” Nothing can beat kindness, for it has magic to keep you away from evil. Above all, kindness resonates among us. A prosperous and steady society depends on nothing but kindness. I’ve got a new home, sweet and cozy. Thank god, someone appeared in my despair, beautiful as viridescent hyacinths.</p>
