        <p>u Why are the questions Risa is being asked so disturbing?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>“You seem to be in good physical condition. You’ve been getting a lot of exercise, yes? Running, perhaps?”</strong></p>
<p>The staff here do care about the physical health of the Unwinds. However, through observation towards a basketball game, Risa realizes that the harvest camp is actually caring about their values, rather than they can lead a healthy life or not. She definitely feels offended because every Unwind here is priced as something waiting for sell, which is like the value evaluation of pork. And no one here cares about the Unwinds anymore.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>“Over the next few weeks you’ll be involved in a program of diverse activities. Risa, dear, are you listening? Is any of this going over your head— would you like me to slow down?”</strong></p>
<p>The harvest counselor defines any Unwind as an imbecile who needs someone talking to them to slow down to help them understand, even for some beyond average Unwind like Risa. Risa feels like the counselor holds ridiculous stereotypes towards Unwinds, which also makes her outraged.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>“Most of the questions don’t matter at this point… but if you have any specific skills you’d like to let us know about— you know, things that could be of use to the community during your stay here…”</strong></p>
<p>It is almost the same question that is always used to question an Unwind— “What good are you?” Risa feels like everyone is suggesting that an Unwind must be worthless. Once again, Risa experiences the indifference of the world.</p>
<p>  In conclusion, Risa feels the questions so disturbing due to the whole world’s misunderstanding and indifference to Unwinds.</p>
<p>u How does the camp’s daily routine make the Unwinds seem to be like?</p>
<p>Risa once imagined the harvest camp to be a human- cattle- stockades. Although Happy Jack Harvest Camp looks distinct to that imagination, Risa’s anticipation is actually true. The Unwinds are like a group of pigs, evaluated, and then wait for slaughter.</p>
<p>u Why are the tithes treated differently to everyone else?</p>
<p>They are not captured to come here— they are totally willing to go. People see them as a gift to the god, rather than someone causing trouble and offending the god. They treat tithes specially and carefully to “help” tithes complete their common destiny.</p>
<p>Also, the special treatment also seems like a sarcasm to the terribles, which are indicating that they do not deserve any special treatment.</p>
<p>u What does it tell you about the Unwinds state of mind that they would attempt to jump off a two-storey building in order to stave off Unwinding?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Actually, the Unwinds can be devastating.</strong> There is no other way to stave off unwinding. They can only choose to hurt themselves to win a chance of survival, which is quite lugubrious. Although they seem surprising towards this hopeful plan, the Unwinds must be sentimental. They may have gone a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>u How has Lev’s attitude towards tithing changed since the very start of the story?</p>
<p>In the beginning, Lev found being a tithe honorable and condescending, but also a little bit confused as he would feel intimidated by the prospect from time to time, almost involuntarily. That scared feeling comes from his nature, which is much weaker than the result of being brainwashed. Yet after the School Event, Lev became totally confused with his identity. The only thing that he was sure about is that Lev ought to re-recognize himself. After getting along with CyFi, Lev burnt the fire of hatred towards the people who signed the Unwind Order.  Lev must have recalled his own family when seeing CyTy with his parents. The reason he got so furious is probably because what happened in front of him reminds him that his own parents were also so indifferent when sending him to get unwound. That’s why Lev totally changed his attitude towards tithing. Lev’s recognition of human nature finally dominates his mind. When Lev makes up his mind to join the clappers, he’s heart is filled with fury and hatred towards this identity, this world. The identity of tithes only means a good cover for him to release dissatisfaction towards the world. </p>
<p>u What is ironic about Roland finally being ‘worth more than any other kid’ in his unit? Why is Roland being denied a priest?</p>
<p>\1.  Roland is unwound like all the other terribles. No one cares whether Roland is dominant or worthy among all the Unwinds. He ends up like all other Unwinds: into the unconsciousness forever.</p>
<p>\2.  No one except tithes are permitted to be accompanied by a priest, and Roland is the same as all the Unwinds to the surgeons, which means that he has no right to require a priest.</p>
<p>\3.  Roland owns a valuable blood type, which makes him “worthy”. However, due to his “value”, he is ordered to get unwound sooner than any other Unwinds.</p>
<p>\4.  Because priest is for people who are dying. However, the surgeon thinks that being unwound is absolutely not dying— Roland would still stay alive, just in a different way.</p>
<p>u Why do they keep the unwinds alive during the unwinding process?</p>
<p>Because it is regulated by the law that the Unwinds must be conscious about what is going on on them during the whole procedure. Maybe by this way, someone who carry on the Unwinds Order would be less guilty— after all the Unwinds default what they are doing.</p>
<p>u How is the tree a metaphor for the Unwinds?</p>
<p>\1.  The original tree is grafted with numerous limbs that makes it show a multitude of distinct flowers. This refers to how the Unwinds “function”. They are just like the distinct flowers on the same tree— the same recipient. However, here the pastor are showing how useful the tithes are, which can reflectively shows that it is the Unwinds that makes a recipient colorful and lively.</p>
<p>u Do you think the way Connor faces his unwinding is brave? Or do you think he has given up?</p>
<p>I think he is definitely very brave rather than having given up. If Connor has gives up, he won’t get rid of the guards’ hands and walk on his own. In the beginning, Connor’s mind messes up which is full of the desire of being alive. But then he makes up his mind to use all rest of time appreciating <strong>who he is.</strong> so Connor, positively, walks forward and appreciates as many views as he can.</p>
<p>u What is ironic about Lev’s final destructive actions in the end?</p>
<p>\1.  Although Lev has changed a lot— become crueler, indifferent. However, that is actually a cover that protects his real nature— I want to stay alive. Actually, as a clapper, he is brainwashed again, which is hidden clue in the plot. This time, he does not choose to obey someone that brainwashes him. Instead, he chooses to fight for what is truly in his heart. The irony can be Lev’s parents’ brainwash, because this time Lev is not affected by surroundings. It can also be ionic for the other clappers since there’s someone finally not so crazy and blind as any other of them.</p>
