        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”.</strong> Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins caring about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>
