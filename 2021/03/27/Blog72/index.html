        <p>u How does the author keep you in suspense in the first page of this chapter?</p>
<p>Connor wakes up in a medically induced coma, unconscious for two weeks which seems like eternity. His body is wound with bandage and the ache from whole body still doesn’t go away. However, everyone should know that Connor is the key Unwind, he couldn’t be released. Therefore, the nurse who comes to look after him might still someone working for Happy Jack Harvest Camp… Connor and Risa may still under the control of harvest camp and can get unwound later. The whole explosive actions happened before would worth nothing…like a big joke.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is ironic that Connor received the particular transplant that he did?</p>
<p>It seems quite ironic because Connor is the one who said “I would rather die than receive a piece of Unwind” before and he tried to run away from the destiny of getting unwound desperately. But now, he received a eye and an arm during his unconsciousness— he got something he never wants…he got something that comes from the procedure he ever wants to escape from. It must be astonishing and scary for Connor to accept. Yeah, it may seem ironic to Connor himself, but it was not his <strong>choice.</strong> Actually, this scene changes my attitude towards unwinding quite a lot. You see, Connor is always the one I appreciate, consistently fighting against unwinding, fighting for human rights. But when he is in then danger of dying, our superhero also needs organisms to survive, to fight back again. I think that’s why New York Times gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Now I wouldn’t be so outright like before emphasizing that unwinding is totally an unethical thing to do. I would be more open-minded. Maybe there are no right or wrong for the compromise between pro-life side and pro-choice side. God throws this tuff question to the world, just in aims of awaking us from blindness and staying open-minded. Fight for what you love, and accept the rest. Just as Nurse Greta said, <strong>“Love the ones you can, pray for the rest.”</strong></p>
<p>u What does Risa think Connor has changed into (end of chapter)?</p>
<p>Risa thinks Connor has changed into a man from a boy. It isn’t Connor’s age makes him man— it is how much he has grown up. The sense of naïve and impulsive have faded away. Connor’s soul was tamed by his impulsiveness. However, after having gone through so many difficulties, his soul begins to tam any other threats.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev’s lawyer talk to him about ‘insanity like it’s a good thing’?</p>
<p>Because from the lawyer’s point of view, he or she needs to stand by the side of Lev and to protect his life from unwinding. Insanity for becoming a clapper actually saves Lev’s life due to the chemicals in his blood. Therefore, “insanity like it” is a good thing for Lev which get him out of unwinding destiny.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is fitting that Connor has taken over the Graveyard?</p>
<p>Connor is probably the most suitable leader of Graveyard.</p>
<p>\1.  He owns a good reputation and authority— from the “rumor” of Akron Unwind to what happens at Happy Jack Harvest Camp, the Unwinds respect and believe in him.</p>
<p>\2.  He owns excellent leadership. Connor unites all the Unwinds in Graveyard to contribute to what they are fighting for.</p>
<p>\3.  Connor can now handle this responsibility. The courage of risking for life remains while the impulsiveness for acting without thinking vanishes.</p>
<p>\4.  Connor’s previous experiences are closely related to this place. He knows it well.</p>
<p>u Is the final message of the novel a positive one? Why?</p>
<p>It is a positive one, at least for Connor. Someone he loves, good friends, and all the kids facing the Unwind Order are all with him. Connor knows that now he doesn’t need to fight alone anymore. More importantly, he can see hope despite the threat of being exposed, which offers courage for all the Unwinds to live on.  </p>
