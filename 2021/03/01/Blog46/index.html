        <p><strong>Part TWO:</strong></p>
<p>u Why aren’t there pictures in the newspaper of the AWOLs? Is this a good or bad thing? (pages 43-44)</p>
<p> \1.  The signal of “no pictures” shows that the cops do not have the usual intension of tracking them and then taking them to get unwound anymore. This time the cops are definitely facing a special case in which they probably want to end up the three AWOLs’ life or kill the two kidnappers, following the order of Lev’s rich family.</p>
<p>\2.  This is definitely a bad thing because at least Risa and Connor now are facing a much scarier destiny of being killed rather than just getting unwound.</p>
<p>u What are Connor’s three emergency modes? Which one does he use on page 47?</p>
<p>\1.   What is different from Connor and others is that he always has one more emergency codes compared to the common ones namely “Fight” and “Flight”, which is “Screw Up Royally”. </p>
<p>\2.   What he uses on page 47 is the particular one: “Screw Up Royally”. In the context, it is explained as “a dangerous mental short circuit” and Connor’s previous short circuit of saving Lev is mentioned before introducing his current action towards the storked family. The author aims to clarify the same feeling of “the brain starts to fry” to show that Connor is using the same mode again.</p>
<p>u What happens to Lev on page 52? Why are his feelings so conflicted?</p>
<p>\1.   Lev moves one seat forwards to put more distance between he and the two “kidnappers”. He then reaches into the backpack of a boy absorbed into music sitting next to him, pulling out a notebook and pen, writing down the “distress signal” of being kidnapped. However, the boy is furious towards Lev’s using his stationary without asking therefore ignores what Lev is suggesting and rips out the page without looking at it.</p>
<p>\2.   lev thinks Risa and Connor still needs to follow the justice of being unwound to make themselves in different parts more meaningful. However, there is something in the darker recesses of his unconscious that is upsetting him. He don’t want them get killed and Lev knows the two “kidnappers” are not a danger to himself anymore.</p>
<p>u Why does Connor take the Storked baby? What does this tell us about his character?</p>
<p>\1.   Because he has seen a storked baby twice on his own doorstep, which is a same situation compared with what is currently happening. That may reminds Connor of the guilty feeling of remaining hands-off and stimulate his empathy.</p>
<p>\2.   This indicates that Connor is empathetic and soft deep down. He couldn’t bear the pain of watching new-borns dying and I admire his spirit of doing boldly what is righteous.</p>
<p>u Did Pastor Dan betray Levi? Why or why not? What situation is Lev in now? (pages 60-62)</p>
<p>\1.   It depends.</p>
<p>\2.   For Lev, Pastor Dan betrays him totally. In the past years, Pastor Dan acts just like his family, brainwashing Lev with the high idea of tithe. But now, just as Lev thinks, “led him to a cliff only to turn away at the last moment”, Pastor Dan forces Lev to convert his thoughts into brand new ones which is completely unknown to Lev. However, “betray” means to ignore your principles or beliefs in order to achieve sth or gain an advantage for yourself. Maybe Pastor Dan has never betrayed his faith. For Pastor Dan, everything all happens in a sudden that he may not have the chance to explain something that is hidden.</p>
<p>\3.   Lev is now dealing with a mixed feeling composed of happy, scared and confused. He has made the mistake which diminishes Connor and Risa’s trust towards him meanwhile deciding to face the unknown self and make up for what he has done.</p>
<p>u Why do you think the teacher helps the Unwinds, even though she knows helping them is a federal crime? (pages 63-64)</p>
<p>\1.   Because the teacher is experienced. She knows “how often compassion takes a back seat to expediency” and “kids only have this kind of desperation in their eyes when they’re going to be unwound. The teacher has seen so many miserable tragedies so she is quite empathetic. She once had the thought of these two “put myself and the school at risk”, but then understand what Connor is saying: “please be a human being”, because deep down the teacher approves that she ought to save living-beings from death.</p>
<p>u Where does the teacher take the Unwinds? What kind of place is it?</p>
<p>\1.   She leads the unwinds to the exist however Risa and Connor are recognized and followed by cops. They then create a great mess, pretending to be clappers and in the boiling crowd the teacher points the way to antique shop on Fleming Street and someone called Sonia.</p>
<p>\2.   The antique shop is in an older part of town and is quite old, with only one consumer and plenty of odd antiques.</p>
<p>u What does Sonia recommend Risa do to stay safe? How do Risa and Connor react? (page 74)</p>
<p>\1.   Sonia recommends Risa to have Connor get her pregnant “again” to stay safe because an expectant mother will not be unwound and Risa will then be bought nine whole months.</p>
<p>\2.   Both of them feel embarrassed and are silently against this idea. Risa is even annoyed by Sonia’s behaviors.</p>
<p>u What three other Unwinds do they meet? Why are they being unwound?</p>
<p>\1.   The three other unwinds are not moving and look exhausted and wary. </p>
<p>\2.   The smirker, Hayden comes from a ridiculously wealthy family however his parents got divorce and the brutal battle over him could not be resolved after two years. In the end his parents preferred getting Hayden unwound to allowing the other to have custody. </p>
<p>\3.   The Asian girl with pink hair is Mai. As the fourth girl in her family, she is nothing to them compared with the new-born son.</p>
<p>\4.   The big kid with a shark tattoo is Roland. He is being unwound because Roland beat up his stepfather for beating him mom who unexpectedly chose her husband’s side.</p>
<p>u Who is Roland? What tattoo does he have on his arm? What kind of person is he?</p>
<p>\1.   Roland is a muscular guy hidden behind Sonia’s trapdoor with other two unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.   He has a shark tattoo on his arm which looks scary.</p>
<p>\3.   Roland is ambitious, aggressive and suspicious. He has a dream of being a military boeuf and is strong enough to fight against his stepfather. He is probably the least friendly unwind among the three for his looks at Connor with intense distrust when they first meet.</p>
