<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Surprise! Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! My name is Modesty Zhou from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China. I’m remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite scientific novel I ever read! It is so exhilarating for me to get a chance and show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I was when reading Roland’s unwinding part— the most shocking episode of this book for sure!! “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman I see myself: lie in the bed with flood of grievances and passion, rushing my whole body which is overwhelmed and then on fire. No one comes to comfort me. I thought my limbs would soon burn out. It feels like squeezing a sponge. Fury flees out so I continue exerting force even though the sponge has been compressed into the size of nail. At that time fire spreads out wildly, from skin to heart… from mind to nowhere… rage begins to retaliate— ha, you, no place to burden it right? Then I would invade your soul… we will see the depth of your soul… Fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should have been turned into ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Generally, I <strong>understand</strong> every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I can almost see a little soft baby in cradle with heart on fire… can you imagine that— the purest creature in the world with the “natural demon” addicted to killing— lullaby versus disaster… How could I ever abhor Roland anymore after “experiencing” his real life? Oh Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> feeling I had. Now a tragic Unwind visualizes my locked pain…and everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the despair in Roland’s heart. We are not the same, but here is the magic of reading: maybe you only see a piece of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that person…and oh you are exactly <strong>that person</strong>! The sense of empathy is now intensified which is the distillation of the overlapped life trace.</p>
<p>​    By the way your language can sometimes be so entertaining that brings little fresh fragrance to adjust the stifling atmosphere, just as lively kids. I love this one so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and even smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed (honestly most parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy…), half fruity. </p>
<p>Speaking of the language and content, I must emphasize my enthusiasm towards Part 2 which impresses me so much that it tastes like Christmas frosting given the favors an intensely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time. That is owing to the insightful “philosophies” in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what <em>Unwind</em> attracts me most is how deeply it leads me diving into the reflection towards human nature. Your novel shows me a brand-new world, profound but yet amazing, and more surprisingly connects with my other studies— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc. <em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory characteristics. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, since he may really become a brave hero if his assassination succeeds. Before assassinations, Macbeth has already suffered the torment of conscience… Perhaps everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it is just implying the struggle of human nature rather than our fault. It is not the neutralization of bad and good that makes us extraordinary— it is the courage to leave the dark side. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the choosing test would be eventually sent to everyone. They are less likely to find their real selves undoubtedly. In addition, this one confuses me for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.</em> I once felt Nurse Greta is indifferent and marble-hearted to say such words. Nevertheless, Connor ironically received the arm from Rolland in the end. I begin to consider whether unwinding is <strong>that</strong> wrong… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds… The complex feeling is like our attitude towards the water— it may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> provides readers with a free secret garden to “think, think, think” about ourselves, and about the world. People have intense discussions for “soul” and “human nature” topics. The questions you raised up permit myself to also contribute a “thoughtful” voice which may even help in some ethical fields— who knows whether designer babies would cause troubles in the future…</p>
<p>I do think <em>Unwind</em> demonstrates the reality of human nature. Lev’s transformation is conspicuous. When I first gone through Connor’s story in the very beginning of the novel, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I register Connor’s slight changes implying that he is not brave or impulsive all the way. He had been intimidated by the prospect. And actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. It tells me that some Unwinds’ tough exteriors hide a sensitive and vulnerable soul. Courage makes us strong, but its developing process starting from fragility makes us outstanding. Wow, sounds so familiar… you know it is so amazing to gain the same perspective from different contents!</p>
<p>After reading, I’m also eager to ask for the answers to some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave <em>Unwind</em> an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Dramatically… I’ve been affirming that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side as most cases focus on how the Unwinds fight against the Order. However, as aforementioned, now I realize that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you write more supporting lines for the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Maybe your neutral stance is clear in the aforementioned “perfect world theory”? That would make more sense… but still why did you create such a dystopian world if pro-choice side is also quite reasonable? Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always intends to “set Lev free”? It’s quite puzzling to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believe Pastor Dan is waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But at the end of the novel he said he still keeps his faith… so if he never believes in “a god who condones human tithing”, why did he brainwash Lev with tithing ideas? Meanwhile if he believes in that god, why did he entice Lev to run away? The figure of God in Pastor Dan’s mind may be changing all the time…?</p>
<p>“Lilies smell worse than weeds when they rot.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said when they bloom.”</p>
<p>You can never imagine how much I start to think about the human nature… let’s hope that what happens in <em>Unwind</em> would never come true in the reality. Thank you so much for offering me the novel as a key to the exploration of human nature.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Your faithful reader,</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Modesty Zhou</p>
