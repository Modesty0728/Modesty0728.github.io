<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! My name is Modesty Zhou, coming from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China. I’m remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite scientific novel ever! It is so exhilarating for me to have a chance to show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I was when reading the part of Roland getting unwound…which is the most tremendous episode of this book. “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman when I was reading I saw myself! You know, lying in the bed with flood of grievances washing out reason, rushing my whole body almost burning on fire. No one comes to comfort me. I thought my body will soon burn out. It feels like squeezing a sponge. Fury flees out leading to continuously exert even though the sponge has been squeezed into the size of nail. At that time fire spreads out wildly, from skin to heart, then to nowhere… fury begins to retaliate— no place to burden right? Then I would invade into your soul… we will see the depth of your soul. Yeah…fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should be turned in ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Actually, I understand every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I almost can see a little soft baby with heart on fire… can you imagine that… the purest creature in the world with the “nature demon” addicted to killing. How could I tease Roland before after “experiencing” his real life? Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, you let me see myself. I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> feeling. Now a tragic Unwind silently demonstrates my locked pain…everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the sense of despair in Roland’s heart. Roland and me are not the same, but here the magic of reading comes…maybe you only see a sentence of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that man…and oh you are totally that man! Empathy is now intensified— overlap of life trace is the distillation of empathy.</p>
<p>​    Your language is entertaining, bring little fresh and fragrant air to adjust the stifling atmosphere, like lively kids. I love this part so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed, half fruity. To be honest, the beginning and parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy and stifling…</p>
<p>Part 2 impresses me so much which tastes like Christmas frosting given the favors a lovely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time. That is because of several insightful philosophies in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous, original and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what <em>Unwind</em> attracts me most is how much it leads me deeply into the thinking towards human nature. I never have dug into such philosophical and insightful topic before. Your novel brings me into a brand- new world, profound and amazing, most surprisingly connected with my real life— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc.<em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory nature. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, because if his assassination succeeds, he may become a brave hero. Also, before becoming a real assassin, Macbeth suffers the torment of conscience. Everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it’s not our fault, but the struggling of human nature. That’s why the “perfect world” is not a perfect world. Only the neutralization of bad and good can makes us valuable and lively. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the test sent by God would eventually begin on each person. Therefore, they are less likely to find the real self and see the world with misunderstanding. This sentence makes me confused and even dissentient for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.”</em> I once felt Nurse Greta is indifferent and marble-hearted. Nevertheless, in the end I found out that Connor ironically received the arm from the unwound Rolland. I begin to think that whether unwinding is completely wrong since I had been so stubborn before… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds. It’s time for head above stifling and dangerous water. It’s like our attitude towards water: may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> really offers an unrestrained secret garden to think, think, think about myself, about the world.</p>
<p>​    After reading, I’m also eager to ask for the answers to some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other. It sounds dramatic to me because I’ve been always thinking that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side since most of the story focuses on how the Unwinds fight against the Unwind Order. However, as aforementioned, I now find out that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you write more discourses to support the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Also, in part four we come to the topic of the soul. I read a lot of dialogues about it and also think a lot. I’m sure that no one in this world can certainly deny or prove the existence of soul, which is why soul brings out so many discussions. Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always have the intension of “setting Lev free”? It’s quite contradictory to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believed Pastor Dan was waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But later he said he still keeps his faith…</p>
<p>​    I really enjoy <em>Unwind</em> because I think it recessively but amazingly shows the reality of human nature. For instance, the novel begins with the story of Connor. When I first read this part, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I found out his slight but vivid changes: Connor was intimidated by the prospect. Actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. It tells me that some Unwinds’ tough exterior hides a sensitive and vulnerable soul. Courage makes us strong, but its developing progress from fragility makes us outstanding.</p>
<p>​    Thank you so much for offering the world such a wonderful book. You can never believe how much I start to think about the world, about the human nature.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Your faithful reader,</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Modesty Zhou</p>
