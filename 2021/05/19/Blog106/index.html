        <p>Neal Shusterman once stated in Unwind Dystology Book 3 that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” (186) Contemporary people are starting to embrace various beauty standards. However, South Korean male stars seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups when appearing on public occasions, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. As a matter of fact, people are not concealing the emperor’s “masculine body” by claiming the presence of the “feminine clothes”—instead he is placed safe and sound in their “instinct zone” where the judgement of femininity is formed. In other words, the truth is not ignored—it only needs some thought to emerge. Back to reality, the fact is that people ought to be ready for a combat to eliminate the “blind spot” in order to rehabilitate K-pop male stars: they should not be cosmetically defined traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>Simply, if someone is trying to judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of “femininity”, check the word’s definition! It shows the limitation of convention. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nothing specific about cosmetics is set as the standard to tell genders apart. And what if something is changing after a “long time”? Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards i.e. milky skin and dyed hair, was almost drowned by audience’s saliva (Yi, David). Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to cater to the “2021 status quo”. What seems acceptable now was once against the tradition. Therefore, how did the Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition. It infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots (Yi, David). Cosmetics plausibly grow to be the pressure solver. Overall, the society is evolving so that what were viewed “out of style” are now “suitably” or “untraditionally” with the times. It is an innovation. Should the K-pop male stars be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the current version of definition which only focuses on the convention. </p>
<p>Time is going on. If the definition of femininity is restricted conventionally, then masculinity must step forward. In other words, the concept of soft masculinity appears because of the negation of traditional femininity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appearing in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, can be seen as a “flower boy” superficially, however he was also strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). This fully indicates the moral interpretation of machismo—bravery and decisiveness. It seems like only what their faces look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” owing to abdominals which are not counted in female beauty standards (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). Once again, only the cosmetic complexions are so controversial—other physical features are in the safety zone of masculinity. However, at the end of day, cosmetics can only <strong>soften</strong> facial features, with no relation to femininity because of what is beneath the skin with cosmetics.</p>
<p>To make a final statement, people see how the K-pop females look, then coming to a conclusion that males are imitating. The so-called “femininity trend” actually arises from the two genders sharing some similarities, thus the conviction for femininity is null. Take beauty standards as an example. Fair skin is required for both men and female (Yi, David). Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers from different genders while offering treatments that personify the same beauty standard (Cummings, Aaron). In this way, how to overturn the assumption of imitation? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% (Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs) of South Korean total population are foreigners (Foreign Population in Korea Tops 2.5 Million). Here comes an analogy: in children’s choirs composed of local kids only, boys and girls are always uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. First of all, facial features are in a likeness (no foreigners). Additionally, the makeups are the same. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully males “trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance instinctively which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since this means that they fail the equality between men and women. Standing at two genders’ intersection, K-pop males are still themselves—the kind of person they want to be, no matter soft or hard. At the same time, femininity is also evolving. No matter how, the tradition cannot be used on those boys definitely since they are the buds of the new age, blood-soaked, in exchange for hope.</p>
