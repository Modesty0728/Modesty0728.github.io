        <p>The first day egg-drop project was assigned (April 25th) we had already started designing our final product by researching ideal materials, and eventually our brainstorms “gave birth to” 7 different ones. The first one we came up with was bubble wrap. Since “pod” was not allowed, we needed something to ensure egg’s safety. Bubble wrap was definitely a good choice because it was light, protectable, and provided egg with larger space. Then I supposed something that protected the egg most efficiently was definitely a hen. So, why not creating a fake hen…just an imagination! Hard to get it come true. Kristen also raised up with a creative idea—use soda and Mentos to form foam and gas that can send the egg safely to the ground. However, any on-the-ground equipment would not be permitted. What’s more, the irregular produced foam would intensify uncertainty—the egg was still likely to smash to the ground due to the foam’s changing shape. So, was there anything that can be both as <strong>soft</strong> as hen and meanwhile <strong>hard</strong> enough to heat the ground while surviving…? That would be the non-Newtonian fluid! When the force acting on it, it acts like solid. Through systematic research, we have learnt that it can also be called Oobleck which carries itself as a liquid when being hold still so that “flexible egg shell” would be provided. After sharing all the ideas, we asked help from the internet. There’s a popular method—a triangle brace made by straws which fixed the egg in the center. But that would probably be a “pod” or the egg would fall off. Some foreigners also used a barrel of popcorns to prevent their baby eggs from breaking apart, but popcorns may disappoint the mass requirement. And the non-Newtonian fluid may miss the “most spectacular” shoot…just a bonus anyway. This method was practical (flour + water), and also catered to all our desires. And undeniably it was creative—we did not get this idea from the internet—all came after analysis, assumption, and our common sense.</p>
<p>To carry on our expectation on non-Newtonian fluid, we decided to put it into action. We made DIY non-Newtonian fluid—the mixture of certain amount of flour (45 grams) and water (50mL). I poured flour into a square-shaped bottle, and then the water was splashed in to form the fluid, the process of which was boosted by the use of stirring rod. Finally, the egg was in, swallowed and wrapped up (the container was sealed with plastic wrap and some tape). Mom dropped the container at 4th floor. The egg survived perfectly (although with slight damage to the container). Unfortunately, the total weight was about 165 grams! Soon we found out that nearly half of the bottle’s volume was unused so that wasted. Therefore, we changed it into a long neck bottle which required less fluid around the egg, and the bottle was cut down by its “waist”, helping the egg drop in more easily. The weight was controlled around 100 grams. Before the drop day we’ve done about ten times of practice. Besides the aforementioned trials, we were still trying to provoke innovation based on the uncertain mass. We decided to “take a risk”. Use softer plastic bottle. Considering the possibility of the container falling with its “mouth” down, we also added foam net into the space between the fluid and plastic wrap.That was a frustrating night. Our container fell onto the ceiling of the elevator twice without hitting the ground…and for every time we had to make another bottle of Oobleck! Finally we even risked our lives (exaggerated), pulling ourselves half out in the air and the ground eventually greeted her baby eggs (tried another two times to ensure final success)! And the result was absolutely the same—unbroken!</p>
<p>Here came to the Egg Drop Day! We prepared the Oobleck at noon and the total container weighed 98.4 grams. Arriving at 3rd floor, the egg was dropped but surprisingly smashed into “mango yogurt” thanks to the presence of Oobleck…We both were really depressed since it was the first time that the non-Newtonian fluid failed us! However, later on, I found out the possible reason: we were nervous before the activity so wrapping the container with several layers of plastic wrap! And that actually smoothened original edges while made the container more like a ball…the “ball” rolled so the egg lost the protection of Oobleck pathetically (between the top of the container and the egg, there was no Oobleck, only foam net). To prove our suggestion, we experimented two more times after school. This time we used less tape and the plastic wrap was only around the top of container. And, we did it! The egg was actually dropped from the 3.5th floor, and for both times it survived. Correct guess! However, we were also taken 1 point away for offering a “pod”, since we did not read the instructions carefully which clarified that “jelly” would not be permitted. No matter how we believed that to come up with this idea was already very innovated. Next time just read through the whole instruction page more slowly…and anything else was great! The process matters much more than the result.</p>
