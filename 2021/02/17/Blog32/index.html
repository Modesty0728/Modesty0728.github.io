        <p>The leaders or directors of organizations are often older people. But some people say that young people can also be a leader. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>points:</p>
<p>\1.    The young people are much more ambitious and radical than the elderly so that they usually force innovative strategies to ensure the organization step further.</p>
<p>\2.    Generally, older people turn to be a better leader for their long-term experience, which helps stabilize the crumbling of organization.</p>
<p>Some people think that the age limit (16) for driving should be increased in order to make driving safer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\1.    When the age is way above 16, people tend to burden more social responsibilities, like raising money to feed themselves. Thereby they are more cautious and responsible when handling with daily stuff, just like driving cars.</p>
<p>Open eyes, do not just look around our society. (border eye-view)</p>
<p>They are not legally responsible to embrace the possible consequences of bad driving.</p>
<p>The use of mobile phone is as antisocial as smoking. Smoking is banned in certain places so mobile should be banned like smoking. To what extend do agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\2.    Mobile phone and smoking are both antisocial. From the subjective view, smoking hurt not only personal health but also others’ health, which is a social issue thus should be banned. In comparison the effect of the overuse of mobile phone only represents a freely choice, not belonging to a social duty.</p>
<p>\3.    To be objective, both ought to be banned for loads of noises and radiation coming from phones can also simultaneously do harm to people’s physical heath</p>
<p>spontaneously. Some places</p>
<p>Mobile phone has social effects! (calling someone—loads of noise)</p>
<p>Some people believe that advertisement discourages us from being different individuals by making us all want be or look the same, to what extent do you agree or disagree? Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Revise: partly agree</strong></p>
<p>People have different opinions towards everything so that the advertisement can hardly assimilate us.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisement seizes people’s curiosity so it’s easy to tempt them with crafty marketing methods.</strong></p>
<p>It is people themselves deciding whether to accept the concept of the advertisement and being individuals or not rather the advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people know the purpose of advertising is to sell more, so will not believe in it completely. (I’m not sure if this point and the using of “most” is ok.)</strong></p>
<p>THE QUESTION IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT THINKING.</p>
<p>In many countries, prison is the most common solution to the problem of crime. However, another effective way is to provide people with better education so that they cannot become criminals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree.</p>
<p>If good education is provided, everyone will be affected[<a href="#_msocom_1">AO1]</a> in an ethical aspect, being told the influence of crimes and how is a prosperous and peaceful society beneficial, in which way “criminals” total actions in daily life would be converted into good manners depended on the belief in justify.</p>
<p>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</strong> </p>
<p>It is impossible for government to take each person into consideration for education [<a href="#_msocom_2">AO2]</a> because of loads of factors etc. the gap between the rich and the poor, which means that the education methods won’t work. —–SO, GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT IS HARD? </p>
<p>crime</p>
<p>In comparison, prison adopts people without considering their background.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In comparison, prison involves people in without considering their background information.</strong></p>
<p>Education provided people with more options</p>
<p>Education is less efficient than prison.</p>
<p>Nowadays a large amount of advertising aiming at children should be banned because of the negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree</p>
<p>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits so that they won’t put too much attention on how it influencing[<a href="#_msocom_3">AO3]</a> children.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits without concerning some of its unsuitable contents for a child.</strong></p>
<p>Watching advertisement is also a chance for children to know more about how the</p>
<p>marketing system works and get in touch with current technologies appeared in advertising.</p>
<p>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? It depends.</p>
<p>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is good for the mental health while the reverse is true [<a href="#_msocom_4">AO4]</a> for staying alone.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is better for the mental health than staying alone.</strong></p>
<p>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted by various people and communication issues caused among them.SO???? CAN’T SEE IT’S GOOD.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted thus one can enjoy a life with higher quality.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SO, what is your point? No good nor bad?? Too vague.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pls keep polishing this topic.</strong></p>
