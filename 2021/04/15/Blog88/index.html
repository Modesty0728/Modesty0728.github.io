        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, feeding and experimenting on pigeons which would be selected based on their traits. Obviously, human beings have been exploring this field for centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting to the environment, normally the advantageous living beings would be chosen to offer people a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection of which “genetic materials are artificially manipulated” according to the definition of GMO. In other words, GMOs are created “against nature”. Our research based on it focuses on the first consumption-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon) created by AquaBounty. </p>
<p>This biotechnology enlarges salmon’s size (comparatively a doubled size in some certain growing period), and the time it takes to grow to market size is halved compared with conventional Atlantic salmon which are definitely slow growers with a 32 to 36 months’ life circle approximately. </p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon came down in pike in 1989, Canada, which can grow all year around rather than just in spring and summer. On November 19th, 2015, with food and environmental safety both ensured, AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon coming into season with the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon. </p>
<p> So, what are some details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon are originally Atlantic salmon inserted another two special genes from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Ocean Pout. Generally, the scientists transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs, which allows the original (Atlantic) salmon to grow faster and live in a warmer environment. All ultimate AquAdvantage salmon are sterile females, which directly diminishes the concern of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with the disapproval based on salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, it is backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that the final product is domesticated. Preliminary results also say that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors”. However, although it is possible and finally becomes true that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the final product, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) refuse to have GM salmon sold in their stores as a GMO label is never required on AquaBounty Salmon. In this way, the consumers could be unaware of the particularity of what they have just eaten. It is also being said that AquAdvantage salmon contain less nutrient—“producing less of the beneficial omega—3 fatty acids than non-GMO salmon.” There are worries based on the survival of wild animals and human health indeed, but undeniably AquAdvantage salmon benefit the environment… for instance, they actually improve the conservation of wild fish populations. As aforementioned, their growth time is reduced by nearly 50%. That sustains the aquaculture effectively. Moreover, where GM salmon are bred is very close to the grocery store, lowering carbon emissions during transportation. AquaBounty also has the ability to recycle waste water and resources. </p>
<p>GMOs have always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about their pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new product comes out. We also see scientists initiate arguments, raising up questions, analyzing, researching…We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are relatively friendly to both people and the earth. No matter what could happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate and continue the great efforts put in this field which promotes the development of GMO. </p>
