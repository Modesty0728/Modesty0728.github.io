        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, choosing pigeons as the experiment objects whose traits would be selected by someone feeding them. Obviously, human beings have been exploring artificial selection field over centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting the environment, normally people would select the advantageous living beings in order to lead a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection whose “genetic materials are artificially manipulated”. In other words, GMOs are created against nature. Our research based on GMO would focus on the first consumption-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon).</p>
<p>The size of GM salmon is much larger than its non-transgenic siblings, and the time it takes to grow to market size is half time as conventional Atlantic salmon. Also, they can grow to market size in about 16 to 18 months. The transgenic salmon shows a doubled size comparatively in a certain growing period. </p>
<p>Before artificial selection, salmon’s growth cycle is 32 to 36 months. They’re slow growers, and in the first year of life they may achieve a weight of between 20 to 30 grams.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries in the world use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon was created in 1989, in Canada. People used artificial selection to salmon that grow all year around, instead of only growing in spring and summer. On 19 November 2015, after confirming its safety for food for five years and environmental safety for three years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon for marketing. People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon.</p>
<p>So, what are some details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon is originally Atlantic salmon with another special gene from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The scientists then transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) from it into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs, which allows the original (Atlantic) salmon reaches the market weight in a short time and grows in a less hospital environment. The ultimate AquAdvantage salmons are all sterile females, which directly fights back the concerns of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with the disapprovals about salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, this one is backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that the final product is domesticated. Preliminary results also say that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors”—the Atlantic salmon in the plight of limited feed. However, although it is possible and finally becomes true that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the final product, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) deny the hope of having GM salmon sold in their stores. Ironically, the researches up to now not only prove GM salmon unthreatening, but even confirm their benefits to the environment. As aforementioned, there are concerns based on the survival of wild animals. However, AquAdvantage salmon actually can conserve wild fish populations. Their growing process towards market size requires 25% less feed than Atlantic salmon, which makes aquaculture much more sustainable. Also, AquaBounty farms GM salmon in land-based facilities that means short distance to the grocery store, which cuts down on transportation, and therefore 23 to 25 times fewer carbon emissions also compared with the Atlantic ones. The company also has full control over their aquaculture rearing ecosystem, i.e. water input and discharge, sanitation and the ability to recycle resources.</p>
<p>GMOs have always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about their pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new product comes out. We also see scientists initiate arguments and then prove the facts through effective analysis and researches. We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are safe and friendly to both people and the earth. No matter what could happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate the great efforts put in this field which promotes the development of GMO.</p>
