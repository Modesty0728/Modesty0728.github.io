    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Do a thirteen years old child have an effective self-control？The answer is no. Imagine it, even an adult has difficulty of reducing time on the internet, how can a child be success? What is of great importance is that the “difficulty” can generally lead to children’s getting negative information from the internet. To be specific, children under 13 should not be allowed on social network considering their mental health, and time management.</p>
<p>Varieties of information on social networks can silently addict children, thus the online stuff keeps them away from reality which causes mental isolation. According to a survey carried out by Benedick University and Proston College in 2014, children feel more anxious and stressful during face-to-face communication after using the social network to interact with others. Nowadays minors use apps like Facebook to contact with friends or family due to the development of electronic technology and the social conduct of pro-online. As they gradually get used to share thoughts online which avoids stress caused by oral communication, relying on this safety zone without embarrassing themselves. Nevertheless the loneliness in terms of mental isolation prevents children from expression which is phenomenal for exploring creativity, thus minors remain rigescent. </p>
<p>Social networks can also disrupt children’s time management. Spontaneously, their daily schedule change, damaging the physical health. Since too much time is spent on “virtual wonderland”, kids fail to be organized and then come to the disruption of internal clock representing the unregular resting time. According to a recent research about the status-in-quo of children’s use of network, the number of five-year-old minors who spends over thirty minutes in browsing internet has already achieved a half. As kids grow older, the time occupied by devices would only escalate. Pathetically, the physical health of young ages is essential for the whole life’s well-being as a matter of fact. In other words, the addiction on the internet could have a profound implication on children, damaging their well-being forwards. For instance, staying up late leads to a decline on intelligence.</p>
<p>All in all, due to the concern of children’s mental and physical health, the date for going online ought to be delayed, assumed as a necessary protection against the distemper prospect. These two factors are the most fundamental ones categorized from obvious facts e.g. dreadful time-organization. To deal with such issues, great effort needs offering to guarantee minors with a thriving future for they are the world’s “future”, the hope every person depended on.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In 1837, violent rebellions broke out in both Lower Canada and Upper Canada which were British North American colonies. The rebels in Lower Canada were led by Papineau and Nelson from the Parti Canadien to overthrow Governor Lord Gosford who was supported by the Chateau Clique. In Upper Canada, the rebels were led by Mackenzie, who was a radical reformer against Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head and his supporters from the Tories (Family Compact). There were many causes related to economic, political and cultural issues. I believe that the most important was political factors.</p>
<p>The main reason for the rebellion was the way the colony was governed. All key positions were in the hands of people that were appointed and they were mostly from a British background. The Executive and Legislative Councils and the Governors could veto any proposals from Legislative Assembly so the government was not responsible or representative. Governor Gosford only passed 10 resolutions out of 92 which angered Papineau. They threatened to not pass money bills so the British said they would help themselves to treasury, angering the Legislative Assembly thereby Nelson would call the rebel to arms. Therefore the main cause of the rebellions was the government being ineffective and not listening to the people so they took matters into their own hands and started a rebellion.</p>
<p>Another reason were the issues of the Governors appointed by English monarch. They were unfamiliar with local problems and conditions so they depended on the advice of councils. Sir Francis Bond Head ignored the two leading Reformers’ suggestions. Soon the Legislative Assembly blocked money bills because of this. As a result, all work on certain positions like docks and roads came to halt immediately. Obviously this led to an unrest in Upper Canada which later turned to be the rebellion of Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Besides political reasons, the economic factors were also vital. One of these factors was the land issue. Best land was given to Family Compact while most of land was controlled by Executive Legislative Council (90%) and Anglican Church (1/7). As more and more settlers came in, they could only get poor and uncleared farmland. Then in 1836, the habitants experienced a crop failure thus they suffered from starvation in the next year. In the end, a rebellion was organized as a result of being starved.</p>
<p>Transportation issue also mattered the economy. The merchants were eager to build canals and roads to achieve modernization so loads of taxes were collected by the Government. Farmers also needed roads to get to markets. However, as merchants grew rich, farmers felt frustrated because government did not grant enough land and money to them. The depressed emotion among farmers eventually caused the rebellion full of anger.</p>
<p> We also should be reminded of the social and cultural factors. There were special privileges for a small group of people. All the officials were appointed by Governor, such as councils, judges, sheriffs, etc. What’s more, in Upper Canada, good occupations are granted to Family Compact and friends. As the government was not meritocratic at all, the gap between the rich and poor was widening further. In the depression of 1837, the Canadiens attacked the government because people with special privileges were too rich. The privileges finally led to the flames of fury of the public, spontaneously, people came into conflict.</p>
<p> In conclusion, the tension in Upper and Lower Canada from 1791 to 1837 was caused due to the economic, political, and cultural or social issues appeared in the temporal society, among which the political factors were the most predominant. Amounts of the economic and social and phenomenon demonstrated was based on political decisions which were the radical causes of the rebellions.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>All men are created equal, or so reckoned Thomas Jefferson as he drafted American’s Declaration of Independence in 1776. “Equality” has been a vital topic for a long time. By comparison, the situation is the same to “Fairness”. But are the two terms actually identical? In the story <em>Harrison Bergeron</em>, introducing a dystopia society in which the government is too crazy about egalitarianism, the difference among them emerges. The definitions are distinct for fairness is an uncertain process full of emotions and equality, however, represents something people are born with but then still be defined as a life destination. To be more specific, the difference between equality and fairness is related to the subjectivity, quality, and possibility.</p>
<p> As a matter of fact, fairness is much more humanized than equality, which is more subjectivity. The main character of this story, Harrison, wears extremely heavy handicaps, earphones, and spectacles (Vonnegut 3). It is definitely a miserable experience that everyone tries to get away from. To achieve absolute equality, the governor puts little attention on preserving the human liberty of enjoying advantages, and even destroys it. On the contrary, Harrison dances with his empress freely after getting rid of the handicaps. Real fairness needs protecting personal legal rights. It is exactly what Harrison wanted and achieved in the end. Clearly fairness is respectable to human being thus everyone is truly chirrupy. In other words, fairness is reasonable and can better release human nature than equality.</p>
<p> When it comes to the quality, sometimes, people cannot realize the fact that fairness is a process while equality stands for a result. The handicaps and masks for the characters are different methods to ensure everyone’s ability is at the same level. “Fairness” is taken into every government act in this controlling process, preventing the privileges like encouraging ugly masks to the beauties. “Fairness” is a tool in their daily life to achieve the final equality. After so much effort put in, eventually society in the US is “equal” for fairness has developed along the right lines. This phenomenon remains considered as a “satisfied” result. By analyzing the logic and evidence, it turns out to be a truth that fairness is a way of struggling to be equal. They play individual roles in different positions or stages.</p>
<p>Jefferson emphasized “All men are created equal”, somehow fairness exists uncertainly when babies are born in some cases. Obviously, in <em>Harrison Bergeron,</em> everybody leads a mortal life in which they enjoy the rights to do personal things, normal and basic, like watching TV and marrying someone. Basically it just goes to show the equal rights people have. Then turning to George, Harrison’s father. His intelligence is way above normal but the one of his wife’s is pretty normal. Disabilities among babies would certainly condemn them to a life of panic and frustration, but these situations are inevitable. Individualism and differences are always there. In conclusion, equality is supposed to describe the rights everyone has. The rights are given without disregarding anyone, but carrying unfair qualities with them possibly.</p>
<p> All in all, the difference consists of three indispensable parts. Admittedly, it seems that fairness and equality are similar although fairness is more subjective and colorful. We can fight for this and considering it as a faith. Then without plenty of concerns, equality would come in the end itself. </p>

        <p>Committee: UNEP</p>
<p>Country: The People’s republic of China</p>
<p>Topic: Reaching Net Zero Emissions: Technologies for Emission Reduction and Carbon Removal</p>
<p>Nowadays, the world economy and industry rely on fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) predominantly. Nevertheless, they bring advancements to diverse departments along with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, in terms of global warming attributed to greenhouse effect and eventually, all the factors leading to climate change. Unfortunately, the significance of the limitation of global warming (1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius) was emphasized in 2018 according to United Nation’s IPCC, that is, even an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius could spell disasters for ecosystems. Thereby to avoid the dreadful prospect, human carbon dioxide is essential to achieve net zero based on the analysis of IPCC, indicating that the GHG emissions for the coming thirty years need to go through a declining trend. Since human beings are facing such a tough situation, governments all over the world need to take the investments towards relevant technologies and cooperation strategies into consideration. We are representing China to attend today’s meeting.</p>
<p>As the biggest developing country in the world, China is also the most dominant emitter (28% of global emissions). Due the late development of industry, the people’s republic of China is eager to catch up with developed countries like the UK so that more greenhouse gases above the ordinary level have been released throughout the decades. It has become one of the main providers of industrial goods, but it is also threatening the climate. However, China is now making strides to promote renewable energy. Energy from renewable resources has composed 25% of China’s needs with a total amount more than any country in the world. In conclusion, China are curbing our carbon footprint and fully understand the importance ecosystem so would work on the eco-decisions. In comparison, those well-developed nations with good environmental consciousness are responsible to assist others in creating net zero emission. Therefore, it is very unwise for the America to back away from the Paris Agreement and deny climate change as a source of superpower. The US’s actions are counter to what’ve accomplished by the entire world so that Americans need to go through a profound consideration towards how to maintain a continuous development and in this way the whole worlds could eventually solve emission problems together.</p>
<p>To improve the world-wide situation, China suggest international acts. Environmental Conference would be of great significance to help negotiate and pass solutions from a comprehensive diverse view. The conferee could achieve win-win strategies that foster the efficiency of global executives. For instance, it’s effectively for scientists from various countries to research more about inhibitor. Multiphoton microscopy experiments have demonstrated the rapid cellular uptake of the inhibitor, which is beneficial and cost-saving for declining carbon emission. Also, for sure the world cannot just rely on a small group of people. A top down idea must be connected to intangible methods which finally come to the grass root. Education is definitely a fabulous proposal to make sure even children have the consciousness to reduce pollution. Such lectures and publicity should be considered on the agenda. Cooperating with neighbors is always our pleasure. China are willing to share own resources and academic results with friends as a little bit contribution to ecosystem. Our plans include sending expects and new technologies abroad, e.g. the prevention and control of desertification.</p>

        <p>“Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Mommy! Of course. Take care!”</p>
<p>The woman was waving at her daughter, watching the train leave the station. A clammy wind blew up, freezing me up instantly. I lay on the bench, envious and lonely. Two months ago, my parents were dead in a big fire. This happened so rapidly that the abrupt pain worked like alcohol, numbing my nerves. No relatives and property were left except a few clothes. The train station was considered as my temporary shelter. I began to beg for food two weeks ago, however giving it up because of burnout. Currently, I was thinking about how to get over the starvation as I would never give up my life facilely. There were bound to be some methods of getting food money without begging.</p>
<p>I had a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>No, it was vicious, definitely.</p>
<p>For the next hour, World War III broke out in my brain. The crazy idea came into my mind time after time, frustrating me. It was a moral violation! Mom always said I was a virtuous girl. Her words lingered in my ears, a long time cannot be dispersed. But nothing was left for me now, besides I would return it back in the end… Then I took out my cellphone slowly.</p>
<p>I was sorry, nonetheless I wanted to survive.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I dialed a casual number.</p>
<p>“Du…”my cellphone began to warn like an alarm. My heart beat violently, as if all the surroundings were staring at me, preparing to expose my crime.</p>
<p>A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>That voice must be a lady’s.</p>
<p>“Umm, I—”<br> “Hang on a second. I told you I cannot afford these cosmetics! Please get out .”</p>
<p>I stopped immediately. How could I cheat the poor lady for money? But before I hang up the phone, she continued—</p>
<p>“Forgive me, sometimes salesmen can be extremely annoying you know. So, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Umm, madam,” I whispered, “Your child is my friend—”</p>
<p>“You mean Hyacinth?”</p>
<p>“S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Hyacinth, you definitely know that! What a perfect name! In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…”</p>
<p> “Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and—is she at home now?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the lady fell silent. </p>
<p>“No. She is not here.”</p>
<p> “Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help!” I had tried my best to shout out anxiously and was just about to explain the trouble more specifically, to my surprise, the lady replied without doubting.</p>
<p> “She needs money, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” I mustered the courage to make myself sound steadfast.</p>
<p>Another silence seemed like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.</p>
<p>“I will definitely give enough money to people in need.”</p>
<p>“I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter!” Despite I am the person in need coincidently, I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>“You know,” suddenly said the lady, “You must be a girl with a kind heart, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.”</p>
<p>“Not really…”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.”</p>
<p>I felt a familiar warmth inside, so real that nearly made me cry out.</p>
<p>“It’s just a duty to care about minors.”</p>
<p>My nose stung. Tears stood in my dull eyes.</p>
<p>“If you accept, let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.”</p>
<p>I could not control my feeling anymore. All the lies crumbled—</p>
<p>“Madam! I’m sorry. What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be alive! You are the only person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.” </p>
<p>“My dear child,” The lady chuckled, “This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the ‘wicked’ idea has been defeated by your conscience.”</p>
<p>Her words melted my ice-cold heart. In place of tears, there was the beginning of a smile. “I… appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?”</p>
<p>“She won’t be back.”</p>
<p>“How—how can it be?”</p>
<p>“She died three days ago.” </p>
<p>Another silence, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p>“My condolences.”</p>
<p>“That’s ok.”</p>
<p>“You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.”</p>
<p>I could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Mommy.”</p>
<p>Psalm 25 says, “Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.” Nothing can beat kindness, for it has magic to keep you away from evil. Above all, kindness resonates among us. A prosperous and steady society depends on nothing but kindness. I’ve got a new home, sweet and cozy.
