<p>Dear family,</p>
<p>​    Umm…hi…</p>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>​    Don’t know where to start. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually I blocked my fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. MAYBE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR YOU GAVE ME A SPECIAL SHELTERED STRUCTURE TO GROW UP? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are nearest to holy God! Gosh how could you…My fault, you have definitely been thinking in that way since I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn faith, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, YOU ARE ALWAYS THE DIMNESS OF FIRE! I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from cops I called, I realize how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however now I am, indeed, separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because care from you “saints” are just water vapor forming THE DIMNESS, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (actually brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, and MY SOUL ON FIRE is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different function of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water! But what else can I blames on you…You were fiercely protective towards me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either…I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living, rather than some ludicrous mission!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on your hand whereas will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>Besides, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>

        <p>Today I watched a recent Disney film <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>. That really really touches me. Firstly, its theme, about trust, is very original. Moreover, it makes me recall my own experience: I was also hurt so many times and dare not to trust anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we are hurt by someone we trust. The feeling of being betrayed if like the burning of heart. Just like Raya’s father, Sisu, and Raya herself. I quite understand that the feeling is strong and stifling enough to destroy someone’s fantasy forever, and what is most difficult is to offer another chance to build the bridge of trust. Step first, and you will gain something out of imagination.</p>
<p>Even if you are hurt by this world from head to toes, please still hold your kindness, because the world would always reward you.</p>

        <p>Have you ever been defined as some kind of person you don’t like? I do. You know, I’m born introverted but don’t want to make others uncomfortable.</p>
<p> <strong>I feel like a fish struggling beneath The Arctic Ocean, envious about strong waves breaking up ice.</strong> My junior high classmates define me as a girl who is “boy-proof”. Everyone, even some of my good friends, joking about this from time to time. “I don’t want to be her desk-mate because she is so dour!” “I don’t know her…wait a minute, Uh I see… She is the one never talks.” “You know, my friend Modesty, she never talks to a boy!” Now it seems waves are teasing me while drawing me into a huge vortex they formed. The darkness intensifies my fear towards myself, making it tougher to break the icy layer. I feel so sorry to them that I try to use my miserableness to exchange their awkwardness and force myself to speak out, to change. But nothing happens and I define myself a waste of space. All of them are trying their best attacking the injury that I struggle to hide…and they succeed. Time gradually washes memories away, and I’m so cheerful to graduate. Entering a brand-new environment, I feel so great to define myself again. And one day, I casually talks to a psychologist who is a friend of my family’s about my “hidden defect”. Simultaneously she has tears falling down, and I’m totally confused. She takes my hand, with tears in eyes, whispering: “My girl, the only reason that gets you a ‘defect’, is the lack of your father’s company. That’s why you don’t know how to get along with boys.” At that moment, I’m relieved, but then heartbroken. So I haven’t done anything wrong but only my plush toys know how miserable I am. I really want to hug that little girl and tell her “It’s okay.” But I don’t want to end up this now. I won’t be inclined to self-pity anymore, because no one can define me, no one can decide who I am anymore. I will always believe in myself rather than being humble towards worthless people. What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger. Next time, please watch your tongue, because your rumors are ridiculous in front of a strong girl.</p>

<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>   I don’t know where to start, really. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually I blocked my fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. <strong>Maybe I should be thankful for you specially give me a sheltered structure to grow up?</strong> Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are the direct treasure of holy God! Gosh how could you…My fault, you definitely are thinking in that way once I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind: living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world” instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn ideas, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, <strong>you are the dimness of fire!</strong> I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from cops I called, I realize how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however now I am, indeed, separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart, and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because care from you “saints” are just water vapor forming <strong>the dimness</strong>, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (actually brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, and <strong>my soul on fire</strong> is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different function of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water! But what else can I blames on you…You were fiercely protective towards me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either…after all I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living rather than any ridiculous destiny!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on your hand whereas will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>After all, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                Your TREASURE,</p>

<p>​    I don’t know where to start, really, because you can never understand me due to thirteen years’ brainwashing. Ha, you may find it funny. How can it be brainwashing? Papa, mama, you are clever. You informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young thus naively believed everything you told. Gradually I locked my fabulous imagination, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”, “God creates us”, “God is worth sacrificing”.

I’m arrogant, cold, and not compassionate, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous right? Read on.

        <p>hi，Mrs. Smith！sorry for disturbing you at night,but I’m just too exciting to tell you something Recently I’m taking some courses about my future major,and my teacher is in Oxford University…You know,I’m really really introverted  and want to express so many things but just can’t help So you can’t imagine how thankful I am to you,to BCA! I talked to the teacher about dystopia and unwind, Macbeth and Shakespeare (I am reading his tales in advance).And when she mentioned Dickens,you can’t imagine how excited I was to shout out “Signalman!” What I found most challenging and makes me stressed out is the lady asked me to (pretend to)attend Oxford’s interview… but I did it and she said “well done”!You know why?It is because the close-reading interview in about to analyze a poem!She thought I might not know something like alliteration…and so surprisingly I shout out “Wow I know that !!! I also know it is written in narrative version or free verse…” Dear Mrs. Smith I suppose my major would definitely be related to comparative literature (I love English and Mandarin so much and want to be the connection between them)or education…no matter how,definitely about Arts. Before, I really doubted the necessity of learning these literacy knowledge,but now I know that that are exactly what I need for my major,for my future Because of what you’ve taught ,I can communicate with my teacher (maybe in the future my interviewer)so naturally and enthusiastically!!! The lady also mentioned that the interviewer cares more about your critical thinking and there’s no correct answer to any of the questions. That sounds so familiar…because you say that every time before class discussion!!! You are always my favorite teacher because you respect and mildly accept all my ideas… I think you are always helping me with my future invisibly… I can’t be more thankful… As aforementioned I am really shy [Lol]I force myself to raise my hand and that is the happiest thing I experienced in BCA! I’m too shy to show my emotions and I want you to know that I really really enjoy the novel unwind and can feel every single change of emotion of every character. Also for drama,so glad to learn soooo many new stuff helping me get out of comfort zone! I love everything you’ve taught…it’s just I’m scared to tell you because I think my poor English would bother you or makes you suffer…after all it must be very very hard to live abroad while facing so many poor English speakers all the day I really think you need to have more time relaxing so didn’t come to you… I also want to tell you another secret Initially I decided to go to A-level because I want to go to UK. But on the consulting day, our Chinese headmaster Mr.Zhang told me something, that made me change mind totally and chose a path I would never regret,that is: BCA is a real high school, with completed education system. IB and A-level are just only like after-school classes. So now you can understand how much I love BCA, love you…truly  (sorry for typing out so many thoughts … I do have loads of thoughts despite being so quite [Lol]</p>

        <p><strong>Part THREE:</strong></p>
<p>u Why does Hayden call the harvest camps “black holes”? Is the metaphor an appropriate one? (pg 80)</p>
<p>\1.  A black hole is a region of spacetime where nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. According to Hayden, no one knows what happens in the harvest camp only the final result of being unwound. In other words, no one exactly knows the process of unwinding and the treatments on unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.  The metaphor is quite appropriate because it clearly tells us how mysterious the harvest camp and the unwinding process is and also emphasizes that this unknown place is some kind of horrible, connecting to this novel’s writing topic—dystopia.</p>
<p>u Who is Humphrey Dunfree? Do you think his story is truth, fiction, or something in-between? (pgs 81-82)</p>
<p>\1.  He is the “survivor” of unwind order. Like other kids, Humphrey get what he “deserved” after his parents sign the order who however, going mad towards it. Then they hacked in to The National Unwind Database, getting to know each Humphrey’s single part’s new owners and secretly searching them to paying what they owed to Humphrey back in the way of rearrangement.</p>
<p>\2.  I think his story is something between truth and fiction. According to the previous context, a computer virus diminished Connor’s discussion towards Humphrey. I don’t think it is a coincidence or the government wouldn’t be so stressed out and furious. However, Humphrey’s story is also too uncanny to believe so I suppose some parts of it is made up by imagination or exaggeration, but it must be based on the real event. No matter the story is one-hundred percent realistic or not, it’s quite sure that in this mad world parents’ guilty emotions exist and there are some crazy actions to take trying to turn the unwound result into reversible. It clearly shows the fragility of human nature and people are struggling against the dystopia.</p>
<p>u Why does Sonia have the Unwinds write letters home? What does Connor learn from his letter writing experience? (pg 85)</p>
<p>\1.  Sonia wants the unwinds to write down everything not being said before to someone they love. And the letters will be sent once they reached eighteen. </p>
<p>(a. For the unwinds, </p>
<p>is a good chance for releasing themselves from the miserable memories. Writing letters also helps them recognize themselves’ true attitudes towards everything, including family, unwind order, and the crazy world. No matter what would happen in the next, at least the unwinds take up the responsibility of speaking up for themselves and the people who are suffering in dystopia. The unwinds have already <strong>made a contribution</strong> on behalf of themselves to the world. Sonia makes the unwinds’ “useless” life meaningful. </p>
<p>Self-writing also helps them relieved with no regret left. </p>
<p>(b. For their guardians,</p>
<p>No matter their kids would survive or not, the guardians would receive the letter on the unwinds’ eighteenth birthday. Sonia chooses this special day for certain reasons. It is like the guardians push their kids into water without looking back, and one day they see the same pool however with no water and simultaneously are sent a previous video about how the stifling kids were struggling beneath water without knowing whether the poor kids survive or not. When guardians receive letter, there are not danger for the unwinds anymore. However, the easeful status-quo would definitely get them realized how gloomy the hell that they have put kids into is. As aforementioned, it’s just like watching kids suffering from over head water when there’s no water remains anymore. <strong>Objectively</strong>, Sonia aims to get the guardians at least been aware of how miserable the kids are under the unwind order. And <strong>subjectively</strong>, she wants the guardians to respect their kids’ thoughts by reading letters and reflect on themselves about their recognition towards human nature. By letting the guardians know the unwinds better, there’s a slight hope that they may <strong>also contribute a voice</strong> to the world by changing the attitude towards “unwind” to gradually make less kids suffer. After all, they the ones who decide life and death to some extent.</p>
<p>\2.  From the writing experience, Connor recognizes many things. </p>
<p>(a. Firstly, He doesn’t truly love Ariana because she is not the one offering hope and strength now, and that’s why Connor thinks writing to Ariana is pointless. </p>
<p>(b. Deep down in Connor’s heart, he still loves his parents. Connor’s sweet memories towards his family seem to be blocked once the unwind order is found. Everything his family do next is shaded with darkness which looks so hopeless that Connor’s heart begins to be full of it, which numbs his mind and makes him feel like all the memories is in darkness now. In other words, it is proved to be an illusion and the precious deep love Connor’s parents offered is still too strong and impressed to forget. That’s why Connor finds himself still love them, as a spontaneous respond to their love.</p>
<p>u What is the analogy Risa makes between Connor and the teacher/Hannah? How does Connor respond to the question of “Do you want it?” (pg 88)</p>
<p>\1.  Hannah is willing to take the baby, however Connor asks whether Hannah wants the baby, and then Risa wants Connor’s answer towards the question if it is set for him.</p>
<p>\2.  Connor hesitates for a while and goes on the truck after emphasizing the baby’s gender—female. Deep down Connors knows that Hannah and him is the same. They don’t want the baby, but are willing to take it and protect it from danger. Now Connor has finished his responsibility and willingness of take care about the baby to be less guilty towards previous experience. He knows he has done his best to save her, and that’s enough.</p>
<p>u What’s the difference between a run-away and a run-to? Why do you think CyFi is a run-to? (pg 92)</p>
<p>\1.  A run-to has a destination is his/her mind, which is the main difference compared with a run-away. Run-aways and run-toes are all escaping from the terrible unwind order, however the latter has a more explicit plan.</p>
<p>\2.  We all know that in the previous context, Risa, Connor and Lev are exactly three run-aways who are always nervous and wary to deal with occasional emergencies. CyFi is completely different because he is quite relaxed walking along railway and knows exactly where he is going to although he cannot tell.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev feel like he’s an accomplice to murder? Why is this word choice and connotation significant? (pg 94)</p>
<p>\1.  Because Risa and Connor now are probably and caught and then unwound, which is all lev’s fault. Lev turned the two “kidnappers” in so he feels ashamed to push them to the end of their life.</p>
<p>\2.  (a. Firstly this word shows Connor’s point of view is changing.</p>
<p>(c. This word is thought-provoking. It makes us think about the nature of unwinding again. Is it murdering or not? This word not only fosters lev to think deeply ignoring his family’s ideas, but also allows readers to have their own speculations because there’s no exact answer.</p>
<p>u How is CyFi’s experience with Unwind parts different from everyone else we’ve read about so far? How do you think this could cause problems? (pgs 95-96)</p>
<p>\1.  CyFi was hit when riding a hike so his right temporal lobe is widely damaged. However, instead of getting body parts or bits e.g. an arm, CyFi got an entire temporal lobe during the surgeon.</p>
<p>\2.  Scattered body parts may have some body memories, but are individual and weak. But an entire temporal lobe means part of the entire nerve system, and individual tissues are connecting into each other. That means CyFi got a real strong and independent lobe which can influence and even control him sometimes.</p>
<p>u What does Lev realize on page 99? How is this significant for his character?</p>
<p>\1.  Lev realizes that CyFi is acting weirdly. There’s something in his eyes and voice. CyFi is now lagging behind Lev and looks like a shuffle, which indicates that he is quite nervous or stressful. The way of his talking is also converted from Old Umber into menacing.</p>
<p>\2.  This shows that Lev is wary and observant.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Lev realizes that his parents love God more than loving him and he hates them for it. His parents always do what supposed to do but are too crazy about their faith to deeply love someone in the real life like Lev. <strong>Recognize the fact</strong></p>
<p>\2.  Lev’s recognition might be a turning point for his character. Before Pastor Dan told him to run away, he is brainwashed by the idea of the high God by his family. Lev then runs away just trying to be alone and reset thoughts. Through the calm and deep thinking after escaping from school, he finally finds out his hidden hatred to the cold love of family and is more empathetic than he used to be when being brainwashed. Lev’s recognition also demonstrates his beginning point of re-recognizing himself. To some extent, the change of Lev is also implying he would meet Risa and Connor again in the future, and at that time they all of the three are aiming to survive from unwind order along with the disappointment this world, based on which the author is trying to show how crazy dystopia is. <strong>Recognize himself</strong></p>
<p>u Who stole the Christmas ornament? What does this tell us about Unwinding? (pg 102)</p>
<p>\1.  The boy who lives as one-eighth CyFi’s brain stole the Christmas ornament. He controlled CyFi himself and acted like what he did before getting unwound.</p>
<p>\2.  This tells the readers more about unwinding. Unwinding indeed has the potential danger to the one who got the body parts because the organs are not theirs technically. The potential danger is threatening, since people who benefit from unwinding can be mess up. More importantly, the potential danger makes unwinding a more negative thing, since it ruins the life of both kids under order and people who “get help”.</p>
<p>u Why is CyFi taking Lev to Joplin, Missouri? (pg 106)</p>
<p>Because the boy who lives as a part of CyFi wants to get there. CyFi is bothered by his thoughts from times to time and wants to <strong>get rid of</strong> them. Anyway, no one wants to be controlled by others’ perspectives, but CyFi is also going there to <strong>help</strong> the boy because he finds the boy pathetic and hurting. So CyFi is actually kind deep down.</p>
<p>u What rumor/story is starting to spread in the warehouse? How could this be the beginning of a symbol? (pg 108)</p>
<p>\1.  The rumor is about a Akron AWOL escaping from a Juvey-cop  whose tranquilizer pistol is seized and getting himself down. This big boeuf superhero may be on the way to the warehouse.</p>
<p>\2.  This rumor or story shows the unwinds admire Connor’s courage and achievements, which would definitely be the beginning of the symbol of Roland’s hostility towards him.</p>
<p>u How does Risa’s opinion of Connor change after the incident with Roland in the bathroom? Is she seeing him differently than she did before? (pgs 114-116)</p>
<p>Risa’s opinion towards Connor actually changes. Before the incident she found Connor too impulsive to respond to Roland wisely. However, Connor controlled himself perfectly in the bathroom with no anger fled out. Although Risa is still blaming Connor for not saving him directly, but she must have found out that Connor behaved much better than she had expected. I believe Connor is more admirable to Risa from now on. Also, Risa realizes her true attitude towards Connor at that time—this boy is a hero, although she may not like him for so many troubles he has caused. Risa obviously appreciates Connor’s conscience and calmness now. Long before, it was just of being annoyed and normal cooperating.</p>

        <p>Some of my peers are really annoying and I’m feeling down because of them for so many times after being in the BCA family. They are working far less hard than me while still being condescending in front of me. Sometimes they asked me to answer their doubts and I felt like I was the one being taught and I was so humble! Today, Soda even said, “You are so relaxed since you are sleeping at noon”. That really hurts me because I consider her as my friend, and I do care about how others think about me. But I tell myself that the life will punish the ones who fail your kindness, and your hard work doesn’t need to be recognized by them (only by your heart is enough). In the future, when I’m in the university or society, there will be more annoying people, so now what I can do is to consider all the unhappiness as a preparation towards the cruel society. Yeah, thank you Soda for appearing in my life, making me stronger and stronger. And, good luck, in a perfect future with no one bearing you. By the way, thanks for providing me an antagonist for my novel! Plenty of precious resources!</p>
