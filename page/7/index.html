        <p>Today is the last day with Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>. There is a perspective mentioned by the speaker which is quite impressive. Now he makes me think of the relationship between the bad and the good again, connected to what I’ve just read about in Unwind. Essentially, everyone would be in and out of darkness and light. And the difference between good and bad people is that the goodies can switch into light by themselves while the baddies cannot so others e.g. policemen will. To reach a peaceful society, we need to stand in light, but self-awareness decides what kind of people we are.</p>

        <p>Part 1 and Part 2 finally ends up in excitement. Fortunately Risa and Connor find their temporary cover through the help of the school teacher Hannah and  an old woman namely Sonia. Getting rid of the baby, Risa and Connor soon get on the way towards another temporary safe house. Here are the meaningful sentences:</p>
<p>“Love the ones you can,” Nurse Greta told her. “Pray for the rest.”</p>
<p>It’s true. Everyone has limited energy to offer even though being willing to offer heart to all people. But we do not need to blame ourselves since similar chances need saving for other desirable good man. We just need to offer our kindness to all of them, which is already quite enough.</p>
<p>“People aren’t all good, and people aren’t all bad. We move in and out of darkness and light all of our lives. Right now, I’m pleased to be in the light.”</p>
<p>Being in the light is what good person does. But as aforementioned, it is not a perfect world. It is not being in the light makes us good people, but the courage of escaping from darkness to stand in light.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows how electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station. The whole process is divided into two phases, namely the day and the night.</p>
<p>During the day phase, water drops from the river into a high-level reservoir which is formed (built) by a big dam and the intake would be open, allowing the water to pass. Following the tilted aqueduct, electricity is generated due to the potential difference (drop down). Then the water enters the power station. The reversible turbines start working and automatically operating the generator which transports electricity to national grid through power lines. In the meantime, water flows into low-level reservoir and is stored, which is also the ending step.</p>
<p>When it comes to the night, the hydroelectric process begins where the day phase ends. The low-level reservoir pumps the water flow to the reversible turbines, which would be then pushed to the high-level reservoir above. Since water still needs to go through the sloped pipe, electricity is regenerated in the same way. The day phase and the night phase together constitute the whole cycle.</p>

        <p><strong>Assignment 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Science and Beauty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isaac Asimov</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Walt Whitman’s best-known poems is this one:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>When I heard the learn’d astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide and measure them, When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I imagine that many people reading those lines tell themselves, exultantly,**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_1">W用1]</a>** <strong>“How true! Science just sucks all the beauty out of everything, reducing it all to numbers and tables and measurements! Why bother learning all that junk when I can just go out and look at all the stars?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a very convenient point of view since it makes it not only unnecessary, but downright aesthetically wrong, to try to follow all that hard stuff in science.**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_2">W用2]</a>** <strong>Instead, you can just take a look at the night sky, get a quick beauty fix, and go off to a nightclub.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The trouble is that Whitman is talking through his hat, but the poor soul didn’t know any better .</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don’t deny that the night sky is beautiful, and I have in my time spread out on a hillside for hours looking at the stars and being awed by their beauty (and receiving bug-bites whose marks took weeks to go away).</strong></p>
<p><strong>But what I see - those quiet, twinkling points of light - is not all the beauty there is . Should I stare lovingly at a single leaf and willingly remain ignorant of the forest? Should I be satisfied to watch the sun glinting off a single pebble and scorn any knowledge of a beach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those bright spots in the sky that we call planets are worlds. There are worlds with thick atmospheres of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid; worlds of red-hot liquid with hurricanes that could gulp down the whole earth; dead worlds with quiet pock-marks of craters; worlds with volcanoes puffing plumes of dust into airlessness; worlds with pink and desolate deserts - each with a weird and unearthly beauty that boils down to a mere speck of light if we just gaze at the night sky.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those other bright spots, which are stars rather than planets, are actually suns. Some of them are of incomparable grandeur, each glowing with the light of a thousand suns like ours, some of them merely red-hot coals doling out their energy stingily. Some of them are compact bodies as massive as our sun, but with all that mass squeezed into a ball smaller than the earth. Some are more compact still, with the mass of the sun squeezed down into the volume of a small asteroid. And some are more compact still, with their mass shrinking down to a volume of zero, the site of which is marked by an intense gravitational field that swallows up everything and gives back nothing; with matter spiraling into that bottomless hole and giving out a wild death-scream of X-rays.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are stars that pulsate endlessly in a great cosmic breathing; and others that, having consumed their fuel, expand and redden until they swallow up their planets, if they have any (and someday, billions of years from now, our sun will expand and the earth will crisp and sere and vaporize into a gas of iron and rock with no sign of the life it once bore). And some stars explode in a vast cataclysm whose ferocious blast of cosmic rays, hurrying outward at nearly the speed of light reaching across thousands of light-years to touch the earth and supply some of the driving force of evolution through mutations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those paltry few stars we see as we look up in perfect silence (some 2,500, and no more, on even the darkest and clearest night) are joined by a vast horde we don’t see, up to as many as three hundred billion - 300,000,000,000 - to form an enormous pinwheel in space. This pinwheel, the Milky Way galaxy, stretches so widely that it takes light, moving at 186,282 miles each second, a hundred thousand years to cross it from end to end; and it rotates about its center in a vast and stately turn that takes two hundred million years to complete - and the sun and the earth and we ourselves all make that turn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beyond our Milky Way galaxy are others, a score or so of them bound to our own in a cluster of galaxies, most of them small, with no more than a few billion stars in each; but with one at least, the Andromeda galaxy, twice as large as our own.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beyond our own cluster, other galaxies and other clusters exist; some clusters make up of thousands of galaxies. They stretch outward and outward as far as our best telescopes can see, with no visible sign of an end - perhaps a hundred billion of them in all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And in more and more of those galaxies we are becoming aware of violence at the centers - of great explosions and out-pourings of radiation, marking the death of perhaps millions of stars. Even at the center of our own galaxy there is incredible violence masked from our own solar system far in the outskirts by enormous clouds of dust and gas that lie between us and the heaving center.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some galactic centers are so bright that they can be seen from distances of billions of light-years,**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_3">W用3]</a>** <strong>distances from which the galaxies themselves cannot be seen and only the bright star-like centers of ravening energy show up - as quasars. Some of these have been detected from more than ten billion light-years away.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All these galaxies are hurrying outward from each other in a vast universal expansion that began fifteen billion years ago, when all the matter in the universe was in a tiny sphere that exploded in the hugest conceivable shatter to form the galaxies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The universe may expand forever or the day may come when the expansion slows and turns back into a contraction to reform the tiny sphere and begin the game all over again so that the whole universe is exhaling and inhaling in breaths that are perhaps a trillion years long.**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_4">W用4]</a>** </p>
<p><strong>And all of this vision - far beyond the scale of human imaginings - was made possible by the works of hundreds of “learn’d” astonomers. All of it; all of it was discovered after the death of Whitman in 1892, and most of it in the past twenty-five years, so that the poor poet never knew what a stultified and limited beauty he observed when he “look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nor can we know or imagine now the limitless beauty yet to be revealed in the future - by science.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>   <strong>What is Asimov’s thesis and how does he support it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uses facts to support; to refute against the other side represented by Whitman</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ｔｈｅ　ｔｈｅｓｉｓ　ｉｓ　ｔｈａｔ　ｔｈｅ　ｕｎｉｖｅｒｓｅ　ｉｓ　ｆａｒ　ｂｅｙｏｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｃａｌｅ　ｏｆ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｉｍａｇｉｎｉｎｇｓ，ｔｈｅ　ｂｅａｕｔｙ　ｏｆ　ｗｈｉｃｈ　ｃａｎｎｏｔ　ｂｅ　ｆｕｌｌｙ　ｏｂｓｅｒｖｅｄ　ｂｙ　ｏｕｒ　ｅｙｅｓ．</em></strong>　</p>
<p><strong><em>Ｈｅ　ｓｕｐｐｏｒｔ　ｉｔ　ｂｙ　ｓｈｏｗｉｎｇ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｃｉｅｎｔｉｆｉｃ　ｆａｃｔ　ｂｅｈｉｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　＂ｐｅｒｆｅｃｔ＂　ｂｅａｕｔｙ　ｗｅ　ｃａｎ　ｓｅｅ　ｉｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｇａｌａｘｙ，ｉｎｃｌｕｄｉｎｇ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｔａｒｓ，ｔｈｅ　ｐｌａｎｅｔ，ａｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　ｕｎｉｖｅｒｓａｌ　ｅｘｐａｎｓｉｏｎ　ｅｔｃ．</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>   <strong>Outline the facts that Asimov presents about the planet, stars, galaxy, and universe that support his thesis.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Planets are worlds. There are  various worlds with a weird and unearthly beauty that boils down to a mere speck of light if we just gaze at the night sky.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Stars which are bright spots are actually suns.They are compact bodies,which could expand and explode.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Galaxy stretches so widely that it takes every stuff a really long time to travel across or around. There is also a cluster of galaxies.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>All the matter in the universe was in a tiny sphere that exploded in the hugest conceivable shatter to form the galaxies in a vast universal expansion\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>   <strong>What is the purpose of Asimov’s rhetorical questions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I be satisfied to watch the sun glinting off a single pebble and scorn any knowledge of a beach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>To call on people to try their best to be aware of the fact and truth behind objects and phenomenons while they are appreciating the obvious beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4a. In point form, outline the development of Asimov’s argument.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1 - Walt Whitman Poem</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2 - points out many people would agree with Whitman</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 15-Explain the fact that some limited beauty was discovered by astronomers after the death of Walt.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Parapraph 16-Express the concern of the uncertainty of the limitless scientific beauty would be discovered more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4b. How does he build unity and coherence?</strong></p>
<p><strong>unity—- focusing on composition or part of one on single topic —- stay on the topic</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author concentrates on the scientific results after Walt was dead so that the paragraph is always around the topic,which is the discussion of Walt’ unawareness of the limited beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coherence —- smooth and logic connection of sentences —- transition</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author use ‘so that’ to tell us that because the facts came after Walt’s death,it was some kind of reasonable for him not to realize the limited scientific beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5a. Find examples of logos, pathos, and ethos in this essay and explain how Asimov uses each one as support for his thesis. For each example, why do you think he used the mode of persuasion where he did?[\</strong><a href="#_ftn1">1]**</a>**</p>
<p><strong>The author uses pathos in paragraph 2 to express someone’s enthusiasm towards the beauty can be observed. The use of pathos can show a common attitude towards the definition of the beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>the author uses logos in paragraph 3 to explain the reason why people prefer realistic beauty  to support thesis.The author uses it not only for the keen to tell us how general the point of view is, but also stating hard and boring aspects of science.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethos is also included in this paragraph to deny the credibility of appreciating the scientific ‘brauty’,which support thesis.This could better and strongly confirm our positive attitude to the realistic beauty.</strong></p>

        <p>The leaders or directors of organizations are often older people. But some people say that young people can also be a leader. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>points:</p>
<p>\1.    The young people are much more ambitious and radical than the elderly so that they usually force innovative strategies to ensure the organization step further.</p>
<p>\2.    Generally, older people turn to be a better leader for their long-term experience, which helps stabilize the crumbling of organization.</p>
<p>Some people think that the age limit (16) for driving should be increased in order to make driving safer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\1.    When the age is way above 16, people tend to burden more social responsibilities, like raising money to feed themselves. Thereby they are more cautious and responsible when handling with daily stuff, just like driving cars.</p>
<p>Open eyes, do not just look around our society. (border eye-view)</p>
<p>They are not legally responsible to embrace the possible consequences of bad driving.</p>
<p>The use of mobile phone is as antisocial as smoking. Smoking is banned in certain places so mobile should be banned like smoking. To what extend do agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\2.    Mobile phone and smoking are both antisocial. From the subjective view, smoking hurt not only personal health but also others’ health, which is a social issue thus should be banned. In comparison the effect of the overuse of mobile phone only represents a freely choice, not belonging to a social duty.</p>
<p>\3.    To be objective, both ought to be banned for loads of noises and radiation coming from phones can also simultaneously do harm to people’s physical heath</p>
<p>spontaneously. Some places</p>
<p>Mobile phone has social effects! (calling someone—loads of noise)</p>
<p>Some people believe that advertisement discourages us from being different individuals by making us all want be or look the same, to what extent do you agree or disagree? Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Revise: partly agree</strong></p>
<p>People have different opinions towards everything so that the advertisement can hardly assimilate us.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisement seizes people’s curiosity so it’s easy to tempt them with crafty marketing methods.</strong></p>
<p>It is people themselves deciding whether to accept the concept of the advertisement and being individuals or not rather the advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people know the purpose of advertising is to sell more, so will not believe in it completely. (I’m not sure if this point and the using of “most” is ok.)</strong></p>
<p>THE QUESTION IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT THINKING.</p>
<p>In many countries, prison is the most common solution to the problem of crime. However, another effective way is to provide people with better education so that they cannot become criminals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree.</p>
<p>If good education is provided, everyone will be affected[<a href="#_msocom_1">AO1]</a> in an ethical aspect, being told the influence of crimes and how is a prosperous and peaceful society beneficial, in which way “criminals” total actions in daily life would be converted into good manners depended on the belief in justify.</p>
<p>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</strong> </p>
<p>It is impossible for government to take each person into consideration for education [<a href="#_msocom_2">AO2]</a> because of loads of factors etc. the gap between the rich and the poor, which means that the education methods won’t work. —–SO, GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT IS HARD? </p>
<p>crime</p>
<p>In comparison, prison adopts people without considering their background.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In comparison, prison involves people in without considering their background information.</strong></p>
<p>Education provided people with more options</p>
<p>Education is less efficient than prison.</p>
<p>Nowadays a large amount of advertising aiming at children should be banned because of the negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree</p>
<p>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits so that they won’t put too much attention on how it influencing[<a href="#_msocom_3">AO3]</a> children.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits without concerning some of its unsuitable contents for a child.</strong></p>
<p>Watching advertisement is also a chance for children to know more about how the</p>
<p>marketing system works and get in touch with current technologies appeared in advertising.</p>
<p>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? It depends.</p>
<p>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is good for the mental health while the reverse is true [<a href="#_msocom_4">AO4]</a> for staying alone.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is better for the mental health than staying alone.</strong></p>
<p>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted by various people and communication issues caused among them.SO???? CAN’T SEE IT’S GOOD.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted thus one can enjoy a life with higher quality.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SO, what is your point? No good nor bad?? Too vague.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pls keep polishing this topic.</strong></p>

        <p>Homework: pls finish the outline of the essay topic “legalize Marijuana or not?”</p>
<p>Hook: <strong>In 2017, more Americans were arrested for marijuana possession than for murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery combined. There’s one Marijuana arrest every minute.</strong></p>
<p>Transition: <strong>as we all know, behaviors like theft are illegal with lower rate of arrest. So would the legalization of Marijuana truly help improve its control?</strong></p>
<p>Thesis: <strong>the government should legalize Marijuana indeed</strong></p>
<p>Point 1: <strong>the ban of Marijuana intensifies the intensions related to racism.</strong></p>
<p>Point 2: <strong>legalizing Marijuana benefits the growth of economy</strong></p>
<p>Conclusion: <strong>the legalization of Marijuana stabilizes the society</strong></p>
<p>Expand: <strong>following the common sense of boycotting drugs resolutely cannot always be the justice. Sometimes human beings’ mindset need switching.</strong> <strong>It is impossible for us to measure whether the prohibition is more predominant which can also cause social unrest.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The Superhero Questionnaire</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Human basics:</strong></p>
<p>Human name: Dorje</p>
<p>Age: 100 (very young compared with those who has lived in Shambhala for thousands of years)</p>
<p>job (or school grade): the youngest prince in Shambhala. He is also the only son of a woman (died after Dorje’s birth) in El Dorado and the king of Shambhala, connecting the two kingdoms. As the descendant of royalty, a responsibility weighs heavily on him, which is to operate Shambhala’s huge army as the commander to destroy all the greedy rules in world although this mission has been ignored by his family by centuries due to the perfect life they lead and enjoy. Also, as the connection between El Dorado and Shambhala, Dorje is responsible to protect both kingdoms and the ancient culture.</p>
<p>favourite food: wine</p>
<p>least favourite food：beef</p>
<p>pet peeve: greed</p>
<p>greatest strength: brave, responsible, sober, frugal, innovative, strong leadership.</p>
<p>greatest weakness: lack of maternal love, do not know how to love</p>
<p><strong>Origin story:</strong> When/how/why did your character become a superhero? How did they get their powers? </p>
<p>Dorje lives in Shambhala which is mystical kingdom in Tibetan Buddhist tradition. He was born with the power of controlling the gold when chanting Buddhist scriptures. He also has an unknown power of concealing the two kingdoms as a gift of being the connection between El Dorado and Shambhala. Dorje was fed up with the perfect life in Shambhala, and when El Dorado was invaded by several human countries in the eager of gold, he decided to complete the mysterious mission, thus commanding the Shambhala army and returning all the stolen gold back to Eldorado. Finally, Dorje, as a superhero, concealing the two kingdoms in the aim of protecting ancient culture from human greed and maintaining peace in human world.</p>
<p><strong>Superhero Basics:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Why this name?</p>
<p>In Tibetan, “Dorje” means “diamond” which represents someone intrepid and tenacious.</p>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> What can your character do?</p>
<p>Dorje can control the gold when chanting Buddhist scriptures. He also has an unknown authority of concealing El Dorado and Shambhala due to his special identity. </p>
<p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Even Superman was allergic to kryptonite. Give your superhero a flaw. NOTE: “No Flaw” is not acceptable, flaws are interesting! </p>
<p>Exclusive, distant due to the loss of mother. Also, all the Buddhists living in Shambhala screen out extraneous thoughts like greed.</p>
<p><strong>Costume:</strong> Why this costume? What does the costume do? </p>
<p>Simple white dress as a Buddhist with a big pocket carrying the copy of Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>Prop:</strong> Is it a car? A ring? A staff?</p>
<p>Dorje has a special copy of Buddhist scriptures which is necessary when utilizing his power. For the power of controlling gold, he needs to chanting the context in the copy and when it comes to the concealing one, Dorje just need to split the copy.</p>
<p><strong>Personal feelings:</strong> How does your character feel about his/her powers? Like? Dislike? Lucky? Cursed? </p>
<p>Dorje was exhausted towards his super power at first due to the sufficient gold in Shambhala and there is no need to hide the two kingdoms as people can hardly find them.  But later he finds it necessary to use it to protect his people and culture so Dorje enjoys it and feels lucky.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Allocate resource—answer economic questions (for whom, what, how to produce)</p>
<p>Ø Questions answered by Government: planned economy (intervention at maximum level)</p>
<p>Ø Questions answered by market: market economy</p>
<p>​              Price mechanism (invisible): reassure allocation</p>
<p>How price mechanism work:</p>
<p>1   Signal function: price is a signal to both consumer and producer.</p>
<p>2   Incentive function:</p>
<p>Ø Consumer: price get higher—they consume less</p>
<p>Ø Producer: price get high while the others remain the same, e.g. the cost is unchanged—higher profit possibility—so they would produce more.</p>
<p>\3.  rationing ration: price can ration the product—bidding—the one paying the highest price can choose first (especially during the period of shortage)</p>
<p>Visualize price mechanism: introduce demand and supply</p>
<p>Demand: willingness and ability for a consumer to purchase a particular product.</p>
<p>Ø Willingness: maximum utility—satisfaction</p>
<p>Ø Ability: restricted by income</p>
<p>Demand only represents how many unit of good the consumer want to purchase rather than actual consume.</p>
<p>Why demand is downward sloping:</p>
<p>Base on price change</p>
<p>1   Income effect:</p>
<p>Price change—purchasing power (real income) change—quantity demand change</p>
<p>i.e. price increases—real income lower—quantity demand lower</p>
<p>2  substitute effect:</p>
<p>   Price change—influence willingness to purchase substitute—quantity demand change.</p>
<p>​    i.e. price increases—more willing to buy its substitute—quantity demand lower</p>
<p>when analyze from quantity change: base on diminishing marginal utility</p>
<p>when consumer decide to purchase one more unit of next product, marginal utility (next unit of product with additional satisfaction) decreases so consumer is willing to pay less on next unit of product.</p>
<p>Distinguish between changes in quantity demand and demand:</p>
<p>\1.  Changes in Quantity demand: happens only when price changes</p>
<p>​     Other explanation: a. extend/contract of demand</p>
<p>​                b. move along demand</p>
<p>​      point movement—along the line—passive</p>
<p>\2.  Changes in demand: active (willing to buy or pay more)</p>
<p>Shifters of demand: SPICE</p>
<p>S: substitute</p>
<p>P: population and preference</p>
<p>I: income</p>
<p>C: complement</p>
<p>E: price expectation</p>
<p>Supply: willingness and ability for producer to produce.</p>
<p>Why upward sloping:</p>
<p>\1.  Incentive function (price increases—cost unchanged—more willing to produce)</p>
<p>\2.  Diminishing marginal productivity (more output—more input—optimum remain—productivity is lower)—marginal cost is rising</p>
<p>Distinguish between changes in quantity supply and supply</p>
<p>Changes Quantity supply: only happen when price change</p>
<p>Changes in supply: producer’s willingness and ability to alter price and output</p>
<p>Shifters of supply: COTTEN</p>
<p>C: cost of production</p>
<p>O: opportunity cost</p>
<p>T: tax</p>
<p>T: technology</p>
<p>E: expectation<br> N: numbers of producers</p>
<p>Only when price is not same as equilibrium price, disequilibrium achieved.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, three witches foretell that Macbeth will become the future lord and king. Many argues it is the prophecy or his character decides the fortune. I prefer the latter. Macbeth’s own behaviors are consistent with the prediction. To some extent the prophecy may somehow work as a psychological hint, but it actually expose Macbeth’s dark side and that’s why the prophecy seems mysterious. It is ourselves that truly manipulate our behaviors, rather than “true” prophecies.</p>
