        <p>In the beginning, three witches foretell that Macbeth will become the future lord and king. Many argues it is the prophecy or his character decides the fortune. I prefer the latter. Macbeth’s own behaviors are consistent with the prediction. To some extent the prophecy may somehow work as a psychological hint, but it actually expose Macbeth’s dark side and that’s why the prophecy seems mysterious. It is ourselves that truly manipulate our behaviors, rather than “true” prophecies.</p>

        <p>Today’s reading experience is really adventurous. The triplicate is standing on the cliff of being caught to harvest camp. They are forced to get on a school bus and reach a campus while avoid their identity being discovered. Meanwhile the phenomenon of stocking was mentioned again during their adventure which together with “unwind” become a serious problem to think of by the three kids. Also, the contradiction inside appears apparently. Lev is always trying to get away from the two “kidnappers” and unexpectedly expose Risa and Connor’s “crimes” to the school. But Lev is not a loyal tithe and is in torment and irresolution. He is also scared of seeing another brand new part of himself. There’s also a very meaningful sentence, which I have seen a month ago and I believe I now have some new perspectives toward it.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.”</p>
<p>That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory nature. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, because if his assassination succeeds, he may become a brave hero. Also, before becoming a real assassin, Macbeth suffers the torment of conscience. Everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it’s not our fault, but the struggling of human nature. That’s why the “perfect world” is not a perfect world. Only the neutralization of bad and good can makes us valuable and lively. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the test sent by God would eventually begin on each person. So they are less likely to find the real self and see the world with misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>In today’s reading, “triplicate” has gone into exile. I believe love has silently come to Risa and Connor and Lev won’t block their plan currently. Risa gets some clothes and food from suburbia brilliantly meanwhile a 19-year-old woman has just abandoned her newborn in the same place. I suppose a collision of destiny will soon happen on them coincidently. Also, something curious come out: the newspaper only reports the pileup incident on interstate rather than the escape of three AWOLS. In the last paragraph of reading, maybe another turning point emerges, which may lead to the arrest of “triplicate”. Here are some sentences which I think are full of philosophy.</p>
<ol>
<li>“So, what’s it like, knowing all your life you are going to be sacrificed?”</li>
</ol>
<p>​       “It is better than going through life without knowing you purpose.”</p>
<p>​       Connor: Maybe he’s finally starting to see the sense of staying alive.</p>
<p>It’s true that we should lead a life with explicit purpose. But I do not think not owning a purpose towards life means your life meaningless. There’s always a purpose that we have toward life, however unrealized by us, which is being alive. What Lev says means if we don’t have a purpose, than we ought to give up our essential purpose. Apparently, this is a logic fallacy of contradiction. Moreover, living-beings are born with the desire of discovering beauty, which could also be everyone’s purpose that makes our life meaningful. Generally, nothing is better than sacrificing our own life unless being active or voluntary.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Woman: How wonderful it is that she can dismiss her responsibility so easily.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, the woman think it is an excellent way to get rid of the newborn without being guilty. However, I convince there will be retribution for her, from the society. Even though the woman escape from her personal suffer in the future, this kind of demeanor would definitely induce tensions in the society.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>“You can’t change laws without first changing human nature.”</p>
<p>“You can’t change human nature without first changing the law.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically Laws are made by human, so only when human nature change can the laws themselves be changed. However, meanwhile all the laws, including some local traditions would generally influence someone’s thoughts and identity. Thus the combination of the two sentences is a paradox. They can both be true and rational, but I support the first one to a great extent. The change of human nature partially depends on the laws indeed, but the intelligent people are always thinking, and unwinds are revolting. When the tensions in society are outraged greatly, the law can also be changed. And for the first one, it is not completely correct of course. Such laws can be changed, but we don’t know it is the law makers’ nature that is changing or the citizens’.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I watched a film called <em>Alita: Battle Angle</em>. It’s the film adaptation of a Japanese manga and the most surprising message about this science fiction is the use of CG on Alita’s appearance. </p>
<p>The story happens in the 26th century in terms of a heart-stopping adventure of the mechanical girl Alita. The plot is evicted as following:</p>
<p>“In 2563, 300 years after Earth was devastated by a catastrophic war known as “The Fall”, scientist Dr. Dyson Ido discovers a disembodied female <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a> with an intact human brain while scavenging for parts in the massive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapyard">scrapyard</a> of Iron City. Ido attaches a new cyborg body to the brain and names her “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alita_(Battle_Angel_Alita)">Alita</a>“ after his deceased daughter. Alita awakens <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia">with no memory of her past</a> and quickly befriends Hugo, a young man who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem. She also meets Dr. Chiren, Ido’s estranged ex-wife. Hugo later introduces Alita to Motorball, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royal">racing sport</a> played by cyborg gladiators. Secretly, Hugo robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector, owner of the Motorball tournament and the ‘de facto’ ruler of the Factory, Iron City’s governing authority.</p>
<p>One night, Alita follows Ido; they are ambushed by a gang of cyborg <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer">serial killers</a> led by Grewishka. Ido is injured, and Alita instinctively fights using “Panzer-Kunst”, a lost combat art for machine bodies. She kills two of the cyborgs and damages Grewishka, who retreats. Ido reveals that he is a Hunter-Warrior, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter">bounty hunter</a> hired by the Factory. Grewishka goes to Dr. Chiren, who is working for Vector, for help. Despite Alita believing that fighting will help her rediscover her past, Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. Alita finds a highly advanced cyborg body in a crashed spaceship outside the city. Recognizing that the body belonged to a Berserker —deadly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_troops">shock troops</a> of the enemy nation United Republics of Mars (URM) from the Fall, of which Alita was a member— Ido refuses to install Alita in it.</p>
<p>Frustrated, Alita registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo are unable to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to help her take down Grewishka. Zapan, a cyborg Hunter-Warrior <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully">bully</a>, provokes Alita, and she severely beats him in a fight, triggering a chaotic bar brawl until Ido arrives to intervene. Suddenly, an upgraded Grewishka appears and challenges Alita to a duel, revealing that he has been sent by Zalem’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocrat">technocrat</a> overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Despite her combat skills, Alita’s body is damaged by Grewishka, before Ido, Hugo and Hunter-Warrior dogmaster McTeague arrive and force Grewishka to retreat. Ido apologizes and transplants Alita into the Berserker body.</p>
<p>Having fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout race for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem. Hugo’s relationship with Alita leads him to decide to quit his criminal job. He confronts his partner Tanji, but Zapan appears, kills Tanji and frames Hugo for the murder of another cyborg. Hugo narrowly escapes and calls Alita for help; she abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan does. Zapan mortally wounds Hugo. Dr. Chiren, having changed her mind about working for Vector, offers to help save Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita’s life support system. When Zapan sees through the trick and attempts to stop Alita, she seizes his prized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel">Damascus</a> blade and injures him.</p>
<p>Ido transplants Hugo’s head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector’s offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie; as an exiled citizen of Zalem, Ido is certain that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem without becoming a motorball champion. Alita storms the Factory and confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs. Vector summons Grewishka, but Alita’s new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotech">nanotech</a> body allows her to easily destroy him. She forces Nova to speak to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally stabs Vector.</p>
<p>Ido tells Alita that Hugo has fled to climb a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He eventually agrees, but a serrated defense ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Alita catches him but cannot pull him up. Hugo thanks Alita for saving him before falling to his death.</p>
<p>Months later, Alita is a rising superstar in the Motorball tournament. Cheered on by the crowd, she pledges vengeance by pointing her plasma-charged sword toward Zalem, where Nova watches from above, smirking.” (from Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The film teaches me to be tenacious, persistent and intrepid. Although Alita is dismembered into several parts, she still tries to utilize all the rest strength to fight. After Alita is rearranged again by his “father”, she finds her confidence again and destroys other bounty hunters completely. As a cyborg, Alita miraculously own the pure love with Hugo and continues her great goal after Hugo is dead. As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Alita has been beaten hard for several times, but the courage to move on and fight will absolutely make her a winner in the following series.</p>

        <p>Today I come to notice two more new main characters, namely Risa and Lev. Compared with Connor, Risa is not a naughty and worrisome kid, but a good however not excellent girl. Risa’s school cannot bear such normal kids so sent her to a unwind case. Risa’s world is stifling. You be the best, or nothing. It forces every kids to study desperately and the miserable fate would come if mistakes are made. </p>
<p>Lev is completely different from both Risa and Connor, since he is willing to be unwound as a tithe. When he is rescued by them, he pretends to work together with them while preparing to get three of them unwound in the future. </p>
<p>Written and placed individually in terms of main characters own perspectives, the context and plot is closely connected while showing every unwinds’ perspectives towards what’s going on.</p>

        <p>Last time I mentioned of the relative successful escape of Connor. To my great surprise, Connor is now caught by cops and in front of him is exactly his own father, which indicating the unfortunate destiny is coming again. How can this happen? The incident is attributed to Connor’s carelessness. He has forgotten to turn off his cell phone to cut down signals in case of being tracked. That remind me of the importance of thinking thoroughly to protect myself. Connor’s dangerous current situation concerns me a lot. What he gonna do? Connor makes a split-second decision of running again in front of his father and cops, which is absolutely a very intrepid act. You know, some people can be born with a unfortunate fate. Sometimes they have the chance to convert it into miracle, however only by great courage and tenacious spirit.</p>

        <p>Today I watched a film called <em>Hi, mom</em> with my family,  a great screen work  in terms of  appreciation of mother’s love which makes us wildly laugh with tears stand on the rim of eye. I think the morals are really meaningful which can be inferred from several scenes.</p>
<p>One of the classical scene is about the volleyball battle between Li Huanying and Wang Qin. There are tensions between the two girls so they are both eager to defeat each other. And the furious players are outraged even more when it comes to match point. However, I was so much impressed when Huanying said, “Don’t be serious with the match. Just consider it as a game!” I appreciate Huanying’s tolerance and calming mentality. She is brave enough to put winning and losing aside. Due to her outstanding magnanimity, Wang Qin has already been beaten completely.</p>
<p>When Shen Zhilin is performing comet in front of the audience, he and Jia Xiaoling are very amazed at the calming audience since their friend Zhang Jiang can’t stop laughing during the rehearsal. This particular scene remind me of the different opinions among generals and comet effects on stage and from rehearsal. So when we want to create a particular atmosphere for a show, reactions from different groups of people should be collected in order to avoid embarrassing occasions in a performance.</p>
<p>The subsequent reality caters to my satisfaction. Wang Qin, snobby and arrogant towards Li Huanying, flaunts her son’s relative success to Huanying pridefully. That is exactly why Jia Xiaoling does her best to help Huanying lead a better life instead of abasing herself. Nevertheless, it is very dramatic to notice that Jia Xiaoling becomes a well-known celebrity in the future. Huanying says, “I only want a healthy and happy kid, rather than a renowned superstar.” Even if Xiaoling is not so successful, she and Huanying are absolutely more cheerful and light-hearted than Wang’s family. There’s no need to compare ourselves with each other. Live happily, life meaningful!</p>
<p>The most moving scene in the movie is the young Li Huanying with the real mind of the dying old Huanying answers Jia when Jia murmurs “mom”, which is also the impressive climate of the whole movie. Usually, time-travel series’s most regrettable thing is the impossibility of other characters to realize the time-traveler’s real identity. But in <em>Hi, mom</em>, the climax surprises all of us which turn the impossibility into something possible, breaking the barrier of time.</p>
<p>I think Huanying would never regret to have Xiaoling as her daughter no matter what kind of fate she will face, because she asks for nothing.</p>

        <p>Recently I found a fabulous album released by Dabin in 2019, containing 10 electroacoustic works. Last summer I discovered the single called <em>Bloom</em>. The fresh music style of chorus immediately attracts me which sounds like bells’ slight collision along with the reverberation of flowing freezing water. Later I found myself prefer the lyrics than the beautiful tune:</p>
<p>“Where we are stay this way</p>
<p>wrapped up in a summer daze</p>
<p>try to find that piece of time</p>
<p>that let’s me freeze you in my mind</p>
<p>I don’t want us to change don’t want us to chip away</p>
<p>oh I am trying to save our bodies against the waves</p>
<p>could we stay in bloo-oo-oom</p>
<p>everything is new ooh ooh</p>
<p>I don’t want to leave this room just let me stay</p>
<p>let me stay with you</p>
<p>could we stay in bloo-oo-oom</p>
<p>could we stay in </p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>holding tight to what we had</p>
<p>if it’s lost will it come back</p>
<p>tell me if this windin’road</p>
<p>is made of dirt or made of gold</p>
<p>…………”</p>
<p>It was exactly the gratuate season when I was listening to this song. And I thought the bloom was refering to our fine youth, which together with my friendship I afraid to chip away. I’m also crazy over the unique style of the album’s cover, drawn by Erica William. It demonstrates a group of teenagers are ready to conceur danger without any fear in a painting style much similar to Miyazaki Hayao, which fully applies colors to a drawing of Utopia.</p>

        <p>“Maybe someone is suitable to stay in 2020.”</p>
<p>When I first saw this piece of comment, it seems the only layer of meaning is： I’d better stay in this year to burden pains over and over again to stay strong in order to meet cruel society in future. But today, which is also the last day of 2020 in lunar year, eventually I discover something else that it is implying. It is someone in my memory that should stay in 2020 indeed, rather than myself. However, I would not deny their existence, but generally “let it go”, which is in the likeness of dust covered by fallen leaves.</p>
<p>However, we are supposed to move on. Someone once said, “The flowing water is competing for lasting gush rather than speed”. Li Bai, the genius poet in Tang Destiny, exclaims: “Send word to songbirds: stop quarreling and fly towards sky, which is thousands of miles high. “ My dear, friends, experience the sensation of running forward wildly, cuz only in this way can we reach the peak of the mountain of life, having a great view of unknown panorama.</p>
<p>someone is suitable to stay in 2020.</p>
<p>Thank you for these living-beings’ company, but you will never be the one who makes me better.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                             write in the end of 2020 (lunar year)</p>
