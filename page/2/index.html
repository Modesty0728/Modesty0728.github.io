    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Will Simultaneous Languages Input Lay Children in Danger?</p>
<p>Nowadays, quite a bunch of children at a young age are exposing to one and even more foreign languages. Take the bilingual country Canada as an example: Quebec is her only province whose majority is Francophone and so that the official language is unique. The truth is that the Quebec families are often mixed with anglophone, francophone, and sometimes even Native members. Even if a pure British-speaking family are “independently” thriving, children can never be guaranteed for not interacting with any different language speakers around the whole province (Wikipedia contributors, 2021). With this phenomenon, sociolinguists are worrying about whether there is an advantageous measure to pour languages into kids’ brains simultaneously (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.).</p>
<p>Communicative language teaching is a meaning-based approach in second language acquisition. In this case the potential-bilingually-speaking children can also master the target languages through simultaneous oral output. Then questions rise: can the children use the two (or more) languages separately without mixing them up, or in other words, avoid compelling conversations with random- languages-fragments? And if so, will they still be equipped with the basic skills of pouring out a complete sentence which only focuses on one language at one time? It sounds intimidatingly authentic. At the end of the day, unfortunately, it is proved to be necessarily concerned to some extent. According to the research, part of people’s misgivings are true—the languages can be combinedly used, sometimes not an unrest in language system (McGill University Health Centre, n.d.), but an case similar to what happens on second language learners—codeswitching. For instance, children’s daily English speaking can be alternated subtly with the use of another language. With the same kind of phenomenon occurring, second language learners find it helpful to change their language mode systematically in order to deliver a particular idea that requires “perfect bon mot to come across effectively” (<em>NPR Cookie Consent and Choices</em>, 2013). Or they simply feel necessary to use this language instead to make up for the disabled expression in previous tongue. Certainly, those children can be in the same circumstances, and therefore the combinations are just fine. But if the aforementioned “unrest in language system” comes true (since they do not share a foundation of the first language which is so solid that it almost won’t disturbing the new language learning), e.g. more easily to get confused with the similar words’ pronunciation in French and British respectively, the bilingual learning will definitely be slower in development (G. 2018). Children will absolutely need more time to clarify the differences between/among languages in consideration of further study.</p>
<p>Besides the potential disadvantages compared to second language learners, children benefit from something equally at last this time. As language drills overlaying like colors on paintings, their common underlying proficiency is emerging and then consolidating. It is about the set of “skills and implicit metalinguistic knowledge” a kid collects as he or she is learning one language which can be “drawn upon when working in another language” (Shoebottom, n.d.). Unlike second language learners, these kids can boost their common underlying proficiency twice every time from the simultaneous learnings in relatively a short period so that their learning can be promptly superior conversely. This is a great time-saving advantage. However, besides the “common zone” across two languages, the confusion often happens among microscopic pronunciation or grammar as aforementioned, and macroscopic cultural differences. Spanish and Portuguese share the similar language framework of Latin Languages. Children who study these two together certainly execute a win-win strategy. However, those from Chinese-American families won’t be so lucky since Mandarin and English are two independently developed languages. Therefore, beginning two languages can be quite challenging if “starting from zero”.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are potential dangers for young children to study two or more languages at the same time due to the lack of mother tongue foundation compared with second language learners who can learn L2&amp;3 one by one, or in other words, “in blocks”. They can get confused frequently without the concentration on only one foreign language. And even if children avoid confusion between languages, the difficulty of learning two totally unrelated languages doubles without benefiting from cultural context connection. But as more time spent on repeating, and children insisting, common proficiency can be developed that will gradually form a virtuous circle. No matter how, Parents should decide critically in terms of their children’s circumstances.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>To those friends who have read both <em>Unwind</em> and <em>Lord of the Flies</em>:</p>
<p>A simple but profound question: <strong>is it ever possible for groups of young children who live without mental illness to choose to give up their lives willingly?</strong> Well, before reading the two novels, I would consider this piece of statement as the most absurd. But as you all know, through reading you can experience distinct lives of numerous characters. Their encounters make me believe in something impossible in real life. So, I guess you are still recalling why those kids wanna go dying so firmly. Alexander Hamilton has actually given us the answer. He said, “There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself.” And if we now take a review of the two novels, we would find out that the cases when children give up their lives happen when their liberty reaches the peak. Well, you may think: every kid want liberty! How can liberty be their killers? So now, let’s take a deep dive into the two novels.</p>
<p>The first one: <em>Unwind</em> by Neal Shusterman. It tells that in the future, although abortion is illegal, parents can choose to sign the Unwind Order to “dismiss” their unwanting kids and donate their parts to medical uses. The word “unwind” here just means to dismember. So just imagine that your parents decide to divide your soul just because you haven’t come first in recent exams and they tell you nothing before the juvie cops take you away from them forever. Spontaneously some children become an AWOL, which means that they go on exile like a prisoner. But actually, the AWOLs own extreme liberty since <strong>they have the choice to decide whether to live on (or in other words being unwound since you are technically alive on recipients), or die.</strong> Holding the life-and-death choice means extreme freedom. Those children are free spiritually despite being traced by juvie cops and their parents assigning the Unwind Order. They don’t want to obey the parents who do not love them and the dystopian world that cruelly decides their fortune without their permissions. They seem to be the ones with the least freedom, but the moment when they light up the courage to escape from this crazy world, they are totally free spiritually. They can choose to end the exile life and “continue” their lives “technically”. But most of them would rather “stay whole”, and “die wholly”. In this case, this group of children says, “I would rather die than being unwound.”, as a protest to the crazy world.</p>
<p>Similarly, children in LOF also get the whole liberty.</p>
<p>It talks about that due to a plane crash during the world war, a group of children have to stay and survive on an isolated island. There are no adults at all and as time flies by, civilization is fading away so that the children’s animal nature begins to emerge. Imagine that: no adults. Nearly every kid is exhilarated since they can do anything they want. However, it is exactly their enviable liberty that gradually diminishes their desire of seeking help. Civilization is fading away along with the boost of liberty. Children become impulsive and only “live in moment”. They fall in deep love with nature, and become savages who only addicted to hunting. Ultimately, they do not care about creating big fire to attract attention to get rescued anymore. In other words, the children actually choose to give up their lives when facing the charm of hunting. In this case, children in Lord of the Flies say, “I would rather go hunting than being rescued.”</p>
<p>So what can be summarized from the two cases? For children, extreme liberty can not only lead to savagery physically, but also spiritual freedom. The combat between the children from Lord of the Flies and Unwind exemplifies the impulse of giving up life versus the courage of giving up life. Whether liberty means a good thing is about whether giving extreme liberty to bodies or spirits. If children choose to give extreme liberty to spirits, then they only die physically (Unwind). (Verse versa). And we almost all agree that only spiritual death says effective goodbye to the world. Those who only die physically continue the life of their spirits. To sum up, Lord of the Flies demonstrates the degeneration of human nature while the reverse is true for Unwind when all the children are offered the same precious thing: liberty which can be a double-edged sword.</p>

        <p>In the first leadership class, Mrs. Ardhy lead us to gone through the proper process of dealing with crisis, which is getting know what is going on -&gt; decide quickly -&gt; communicating -&gt; terminate the crisis and move on, according to my personal summary. In the beginning I thought that it is really a tough thing to deal with since we have quite many procedures to follow and I did not consider myself having such kind of ability. However, after Office Hour, I learnt that we can also and should be optimistic when facing conflicts in team work since I should be glad that my team is so diverse and unique. I believe it is the same for the crisis. Not only should we keep an optimistic mind when dealing with crisis in order to utilize our confidence to solve the problem, optimism but also means that I have an open mind to the diversity and colourful minds in my team. Thanks to those distinct thoughts, I can get the precious chance to witness the existence of crisis. And that is what makes my team success in the future.</p>

        <p>An idiom is an expression that cannot be understood from the meanings of its separate word but has a separate meaning of its own. Idioms are not simply about languages anymore, but the <strong>epitomizer</strong> of local culture that gives special implication to surface meaning and definitely has profound impact on human mindset about how to understand a language flexibly in different circumstances. Applied to our project, why are there so many idioms about gender equality in China and Arab countries? Because of their sexism folk cultures. And eventually, gender stereotypes are solidified in people’s mindsets.</p>

        <p>Before applying for HSYLC, I did not consider about the reason why I wanted to spend ten days on it. When I started to browse its website, I found out that this summer camp is associated with the part that I was never familiar with, i.e. liberal arts. And it was the the first time that I was so deeply attracted and loosened the determination of going for UK universities. And HSYLC is about leadership in majority, which was also one of the parts that I never touched. So I just decided to do an experience, and go out of my comfort zone again. </p>
<p>In my great surprise, I received the most exciting news of this year– I was accepted by HSYLC! Then came to the most exciting part– selecting seminars/capstone projects/frontier conversations/info sessions… I did want to immerse myself into my literary major world. But I knew, that I came here, to go out of my comfort zone, and to experience liberal arts. So I did the most excellent action this year: I chose only one seminar based on my major. And for the rest, I tried what is wholly out of interests: leadership, nutrition, linguistics, Arab. I was so exhilarated since it was the first step of understanding what is liberal arts, truly.</p>
<p>In autumn, I tried to find resources in order to take the place of HSYLC seminars due to the pervasive virus, but feel so lucky to be involved in again to gain loads of skills that unexpectedly emerged during daily interactions.</p>
<p>I learned systematically about Tang shi and Song ci. At the end of the day, there are so many rules the ancient needed to follow! Being plagued by those fixed rhythm, I know that I still have a long way to go in order to become proficient in my country’s culture.</p>

        <p>Roger and Maurice exercise their power through violence which turn to a more savage level when it comes to Roger. They both distract the littluns in the way of destroying their sand castles to boost their authorities. Roger involves in distractions more. He even tries to throw stones at Henry, which gives the sense of satisfaction when bringing oppression to littluns. As a such younger kid, Henry chooses another distinct way instinctively. He prefers to settle himself with comparatively younger kids while controlling the surrounding creatures. Ordering and talking to these living beings offers him a basic awareness of how makes others listen to himself. The similarity among all the three boys is their common preference of staying with someone younger, because the self-righteous “maturity” boosts their vanity, and also their desire of power.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>What is internal beauty? Many people would list out numerous virtues, like modesty, kindness, and bravery, etc. I agree. But these personality traits also work as “appearance” in the level of internality since moral is probably the first thing we notice when looking deeply into internality. They are also like the beautiful wraps which make people look good, and sometimes people frequently acknowledge the justice of internal beauty even if they only see one of the numerous virtues, like “Wow she is so virtuous! She is so beautiful internally!” Sounds like people are simply judging you based on complexion again, though not wearing real cosmetics literally. Everyone could be related to one or more of these good characteristics, so does it mean that everyone is beautiful internally? What makes people’s “external appearances” intrigued” is being <strong>natural—relaxed and not pretending to be something different about externality</strong>. That actually means the less attention towards appearance, which is also the origin of other characteristics since in this way people are capable to appreciate something more insightful or important. </p>
<p>As aforementioned, the definition of external beauty is also to <strong>be natural</strong>, which is derived from my own definition of internal beauty. This time “being natural” means <strong>to exist in nature, but not made or caused by humans</strong>. With natural internality, natural externality comes. I always believe that there are tons of ways to make yourself look more attractive, e.g. plastic surgeries, make-ups. But nature shows the real self. That is who you are, really, and everyone should be proud of what they born to be. Reality makes you shine, because you convey sincere pleasure to others. Cosmetics can only boost your “flashy” confidence which is never eternal.</p>
<p>Being nature is the secret of inside-out beauty. The external reality indicates the peace beneath skin where how you look externally is also decided. The definition of beauty is to bring pleasure to people. What nature brings to us is the purest satisfaction. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I do think that the Kardashians have had a negative influence on beauty standards. The family is adored by many people around the world with labels such as “hot” and “socialite”. Kardashians are frequent social media users which entice young girls to imitate. According to the video, tons of girls cannot conceal their desire to “be a Kardashian”. It seems like Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty magnify these girls’ figure defects which is never something to feel shame about. Kardashians have set girls’ beauty standards away from reality. This would also lead to too many similarities in aesthetics, so Barbie dolls are not for sell anymore—they are everywhere, since girls become Barbies. Besides Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty standards, there are also “consuming” their beauty. They claim that girls all over the world can own the “perfect” figure as themselves by using Kardashians’ products. They are clever—Kardashians utilize girls’ anxiety to make money, and the cost of money makes these girls think that they are doing something meaningful and correct. In this way, the rationality of holding unrealistic beauty standards are corroborated.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Aristotle once believed that at some places of the world, “the sky was vomiting little bits of flames”. So what are the “flames on sky” exactly? If you look up in North and South poles, nowadays you would still probably see spectacular beautiful lights, especially at nights. These are auroras, also named as polar lights. They are the colored curtains glittering in northern and southern regions of the world. </p>
<p>Some people may get used to calling it “northern lights”. Actually, both North and South pole offer free aurora tickets for tourists. They only differ in names—aurora borealis in the Arctic and aurora australis over its opposite land. Generally, they exceed the Earth’s surface by 80-250 kilometers, which is the height of upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>The oldest record of aurora traces back to Tribal Period of China. The emperor—</p>
<p>Shuan-Yuan’s mother once saw intense lights flowing around Bei-Dou’s constellation. Later, sketch depicted auroras as “clouds with candles burning above”.</p>
<p>So, how is aurora formed? Thanks to our old friend—the sun, people can enjoy such spectacular universal view. Due to the rapid temperature variation, this big radiative star often gives off steady solar wind by bubbling, however there could also be extreme weather. When solar storms approach the Earth, here comes the beginning of universal miracle. According to NASA, solar energy comes into and then reconfigure the magnetic field where tremendous energy is eventually released in forms of electrons and protons. These energetic particles hit and ignite the oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. Usually, red and green auroras are related oxygen while the purple and blue luminous body is nitrogen. Therefore, we can see colorful skies in polar areas. Normally, every 11 years, the spectacle reach the peak. Pathetically, air pollution is affecting global atmosphere. Contemporary luminance falls to the weakest on record according to a senior advisor of NASA. </p>
<p>If you think the Earth is the only wonderland to take a look of polar lights, then you may want to expand your knowledge about the space! The only necessities for an aurora to show up are: solar storm, planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. Up-to-now, scientists have detected auroras over Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. Their colors differ, owing to different compositions of elements in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Astrology researchers are still unsure about whether the phenomenon of aurora exists out of the Solar System. But who can refuse the charm of these mysterious ethereal sky-silks? Let’s hope that one day we can be amazed at the undiscovered polar lights.</p>
