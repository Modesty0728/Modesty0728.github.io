        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, feeding and experimenting on pigeons which would be selected based on their traits. Obviously, human beings have been exploring this field for centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting to the environment, normally the advantageous living beings would be chosen to offer people a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection of which “genetic materials are artificially manipulated” according to the definition of GMO. In other words, GMOs are created “against nature”. Our research based on it focuses on the first consumption-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon) created by AquaBounty. </p>
<p>This biotechnology enlarges salmon’s size (comparatively a doubled size in some certain growing period), and the time it takes to grow to market size is halved compared with conventional Atlantic salmon which are definitely slow growers with a 32 to 36 months’ life circle approximately. </p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon came down in pike in 1989, Canada, which can grow all year around rather than just in spring and summer. On November 19th, 2015, with food and environmental safety both ensured, AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon coming into season with the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon. </p>
<p> So, what are some details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon are originally Atlantic salmon inserted another two special genes from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Ocean Pout. Generally, the scientists transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs, which allows the original (Atlantic) salmon to grow faster and live in a warmer environment. All ultimate AquAdvantage salmon are sterile females, which directly diminishes the concern of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with the disapproval based on salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, it is backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that the final product is domesticated. Preliminary results also say that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors”. However, although it is possible and finally becomes true that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the final product, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) refuse to have GM salmon sold in their stores as a GMO label is never required on AquaBounty Salmon. In this way, the consumers could be unaware of the particularity of what they have just eaten. It is also being said that AquAdvantage salmon contain less nutrient—“producing less of the beneficial omega—3 fatty acids than non-GMO salmon.” There are worries based on the survival of wild animals and human health indeed, but undeniably AquAdvantage salmon benefit the environment… for instance, they actually improve the conservation of wild fish populations. As aforementioned, their growth time is reduced by nearly 50%. That sustains the aquaculture effectively. Moreover, where GM salmon are bred is very close to the grocery store, lowering carbon emissions during transportation. AquaBounty also has the ability to recycle waste water and resources. </p>
<p>GMOs have always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about their pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new product comes out. We also see scientists initiate arguments, raising up questions, analyzing, researching…We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are relatively friendly to both people and the earth. No matter what could happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate and continue the great efforts put in this field which promotes the development of GMO. </p>

        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, choosing pigeons as the experiment objects whose traits would be selected by someone feeding them.

<p>The size of GM salmon is much larger than its non-transgenic siblings, and the time it takes to grow to market size is half time as conventional Atlantic salmon. Also, they can grow to market size in about 16 to 18 months. The transgenic salmon shows a doubled size comparatively in a certain growing period. </p>
<p>Before artificial selection, salmon’s growth cycle is 32 to 36 months. They’re slow growers, and in the first year of life they may achieve a weight of between 20 to 30 grams.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries in the world use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon was created in 1989, in Canada. People used artificial selection to salmon that grow all year around, instead of only growing in spring and summer. On 19 November 2015, after confirming its safety for food for five years and environmental safety for three years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon for marketing. People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon.</p>

        <p>So glad but melancholy to finish our <em>Unwind</em> as the end of term 3… I have learnt so much since the winter holiday, and just watch how many blogs are related to this one…</p>
<p>Before I thought my perspectives are untouchable authorities. Now it is so funny but touching to look back and see how many times my opinions has been beat and then reformed. Mrs. Smith suggested us to be open-minded on the first class starting <em>Unwind</em>. And now I’m proud to tell that I did it. What remains to do is firstly edit my compare and contrast essay, sending it to Mrs. Smith, and most importantly, revise the Unwind Project to make my dream come true. It is the first time that I start to analysis an English novel so deeply and has been provoked so many thoughts towards human nature. But I also suggest myself to improve my reading method due to all the awful quizzes marks. Next time just try not to be so “deeply”… you are just trying to hard…</p>
<p>As a remembrance and enthusiasm, I have started the second book of Unwind series– UnWholly and really found something that made me link back to Unwind. Good luck for the furthermore exploration of Unwind series!</p>

        <p>The universe is infinite and no one is sure about its capacity, but that allows human beings’ wild imagination and exploration. They discover the technology of unwinding and grafting, however their stupidity also grows wildly along with the crazy exploration. Stupidity now does not imply that unwinding is totally absurd. It is suggesting we have been only focusing on what’s the next research to do rather than stopping for a while and reflect on ourselves. Pathetically is we ignore this suggestion, our stupidity turns infinite. I believe the author is just reflecting on what happens in the book. People make a compromise between pro-life and pro-choice, but they never stop to think further…</p>

        <p><strong>Graveyard: unusable planes are stored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another figurative meaning by using this as the final destinations of the Unwinds.</strong></p>
<p>I do think it is a profound choice to make Graveyard the final destination.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s irony here. The introduction of Part5 says, “Graveyard is not a land where abandoned planes piled up”. Unwinds here actually have something to do and the abandoned planes here are in symbolism of them. It emphasizes that the Unwinds’ final destination won’t be nothing but waiting for death. They are going to prove themselves meaningful.</p>
<p>Moreover, “keep active aircraft flying” refers to using effective parts to fix an aircraft. I think it is implying the intension of the Admiral to save the Unwinds from being into pieces and ensure their safety. </p>

Moreover, people can never purchase a priceless product, just like a soul. If everyone tries to buy a soul, this pure, intangible substance will become cheap and vulnerable.

        <p>I think this piece of part3 introduction is quite interesting and thought-provoking. It is related to BBC so what happens makes me empathetic and uncomfortable because it seems related to our real life. </p>
<p>And the author included this is not only because of it reflects the main topic of unwinding and dystopia. In the end of report, something familiar is mentioned: “It could possibly be a result of harvesting stem cells from bone marrow.” I can recall the depictions towards Cy-Fi ‘s experience of receiving lobe, which causes trouble of being controlled later on. So perhaps this piece of report suggests us considering the importance of brain and whether it is a wise choice to provide every organ to recipients. I think he is trying to tell us: unwinding is causing trouble.</p>

        <p><strong>What do the quotes by the two nurses teach you about human nature?</strong></p>
<p>It tells me that the human nature is highly related to the law. The change of law regulates and sometimes limits our behaviors and that’s why most people’s human nature is gradually changing over a long period due to fully obeying the law. However, this kind of change in human nature would definitely change the law again since people and the law both demonstrates same purpose.   Thus, the human nature that changes the law is clearly against it and is much stronger than the previous one because it is influential enough to change human nature and therefore the law.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you think Neal Shusterman meant when he said “In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.”</strong></p>
<p>“this isn’t a perfect world” mean s we cannot consider something something completely right or wrong and everything is too complex to give a simple and hasty definition. But “people who think it is” are exactly the ones who are narrow-minded or not critically thinking. Actually there’s no definite difference between black and white because they can be exchanged, which is the secret of the world. People who cannot realize it are someone unclear about this world, living without a clear mind.</p>
