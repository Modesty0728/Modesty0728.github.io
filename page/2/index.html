        <p>In the first leadership class, Mrs. Ardhy lead us to gone through the proper process of dealing with crisis, which is getting know what is going on -&gt; decide quickly -&gt; communicating -&gt; terminate the crisis and move on, according to my personal summary. In the beginning I thought that it is really a tough thing to deal with since we have quite many procedures to follow and I did not consider myself having such kind of ability. However, after Office Hour, I learnt that we can also and should be optimistic when facing conflicts in team work since I should be glad that my team is so diverse and unique. I believe it is the same for the crisis. Not only should we keep an optimistic mind when dealing with crisis in order to utilize our confidence to solve the problem, optimism but also means that I have an open mind to the diversity and colourful minds in my team. Thanks to those distinct thoughts, I can get the precious chance to witness the existence of crisis. And that is what makes my team success in the future.</p>

        <p>An idiom is an expression that cannot be understood from the meanings of its separate word but has a separate meaning of its own. Idioms are not simply about languages anymore, but the <strong>epitomizer</strong> of local culture that gives special implication to surface meaning and definitely has profound impact on human mindset about how to understand a language flexibly in different circumstances. Applied to our project, why are there so many idioms about gender equality in China and Arab countries? Because of their sexism folk cultures. And eventually, gender stereotypes are solidified in people’s mindsets.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>To those friends who have read both <em>Unwind</em> and <em>Lord of the Flies</em>:</p>
<p>A simple but profound question: <strong>is it ever possible for groups of young children who live without mental illness to choose to give up their lives willingly?</strong> Well, before reading the two novels, I would consider this piece of statement as the most absurd. But as you all know, through reading you can experience distinct lives of numerous characters. Their encounters make me believe in something impossible in real life. So, I guess you are still recalling why those kids wanna go dying so firmly. Alexander Hamilton has actually given us the answer. He said, “There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself.” And if we now take a review of the two novels, we would find out that the cases when children give up their lives happen when their liberty reaches the peak. Well, you may think: every kid want liberty! How can liberty be their killers? So now, let’s take a deep dive into the two novels.</p>
<p>The first one: <em>Unwind</em> by Neal Shusterman. It tells that in the future, although abortion is illegal, parents can choose to sign the Unwind Order to “dismiss” their unwanting kids and donate their parts to medical uses. The word “unwind” here just means to dismember. So just imagine that your parents decide to divide your soul just because you haven’t come first in recent exams and they tell you nothing before the juvie cops take you away from them forever. Spontaneously some children become an AWOL, which means that they go on exile like a prisoner. But actually, the AWOLs own extreme liberty since <strong>they have the choice to decide whether to live on (or in other words being unwound since you are technically alive on recipients), or die.</strong> Holding the life-and-death choice means extreme freedom. Those children are free spiritually despite being traced by juvie cops and their parents assigning the Unwind Order. They don’t want to obey the parents who do not love them and the dystopian world that cruelly decides their fortune without their permissions. They seem to be the ones with the least freedom, but the moment when they light up the courage to escape from this crazy world, they are totally free spiritually. They can choose to end the exile life and “continue” their lives “technically”. But most of them would rather “stay whole”, and “die wholly”. In this case, this group of children says, “I would rather die than being unwound.”, as a protest to the crazy world.</p>
<p>Similarly, children in LOF also get the whole liberty.</p>
<p>It talks about that due to a plane crash during the world war, a group of children have to stay and survive on an isolated island. There are no adults at all and as time flies by, civilization is fading away so that the children’s animal nature begins to emerge. Imagine that: no adults. Nearly every kid is exhilarated since they can do anything they want. However, it is exactly their enviable liberty that gradually diminishes their desire of seeking help. Civilization is fading away along with the boost of liberty. Children become impulsive and only “live in moment”. They fall in deep love with nature, and become savages who only addicted to hunting. Ultimately, they do not care about creating big fire to attract attention to get rescued anymore. In other words, the children actually choose to give up their lives when facing the charm of hunting. In this case, children in Lord of the Flies say, “I would rather go hunting than being rescued.”</p>
<p>So what can be summarized from the two cases? For children, extreme liberty can not only lead to savagery physically, but also spiritual freedom. If there’s a combat between the children from Lord of the Flies and Unwind, it is actually the impulse of giving up life versus the courage of giving up life. Whether liberty means a good thing is about whether giving extreme liberty to bodies or spirits. If children choose to give extreme liberty to spirits, then they only die physically (Unwind). (Verse versa). And we almost all agree that only spiritual death says effective goodbye to the world. Those who only die physically continue the life of their spirits. To sum up, Lord of the Flies demonstrates the degeneration of human nature while the reverse is true for Unwind when all the children are offered the same precious thing: liberty which can be a double-edged sword.</p>

        <p>Before applying for HSYLC, I did not consider about the reason why I wanted to spend ten days on it. When I started to browse its website, I found out that this summer camp is associated with the part that I was never familiar with, i.e. liberal arts. And it was the the first time that I was so deeply attracted and loosened the determination of going for UK universities. And HSYLC is about leadership in majority, which was also one of the parts that I never touched. So I just decided to do an experience, and go out of my comfort zone again. </p>
<p>In my great surprise, I received the most exciting news of this year– I was accepted by HSYLC! Then came to the most exciting part– selecting seminars/capstone projects/frontier conversations/info sessions… I did want to immerse myself into my literary major world. But I knew, that I came here, to go out of my comfort zone, and to experience liberal arts. So I did the most excellent action this year: I chose only one seminar based on my major. And for the rest, I tried what is wholly out of interests: leadership, nutrition, linguistics, Arab. I was so exhilarated since it was the first step of understanding what is liberal arts, truly.</p>
<p>In autumn, I tried to find resources in order to take the place of HSYLC seminars due to the pervasive virus, but feel so lucky to be involved in again to gain loads of skills that unexpectedly emerged during daily interactions.</p>
<p>I learned systematically about Tang shi and Song ci. At the end of the day, there are so many rules the ancient needed to follow! Being plagued by those fixed rhythm, I know that I still have a long way to go in order to become proficient in my country’s culture.</p>

        <p>Roger and Maurice exercise their power through violence which turn to a more savage level when it comes to Roger. They both distract the littluns in the way of destroying their sand castles to boost their authorities. Roger involves in distractions more. He even tries to throw stones at Henry, which gives the sense of satisfaction when bringing oppression to littluns. As a such younger kid, Henry chooses another distinct way instinctively. He prefers to settle himself with comparatively younger kids while controlling the surrounding creatures. Ordering and talking to these living beings offers him a basic awareness of how makes others listen to himself. The similarity among all the three boys is their common preference of staying with someone younger, because the self-righteous “maturity” boosts their vanity, and also their desire of power.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>What is internal beauty? Many people would list out numerous virtues, like modesty, kindness, and bravery, etc. I agree. But these personality traits also work as “appearance” in the level of internality since moral is probably the first thing we notice when looking deeply into internality. They are also like the beautiful wraps which make people look good, and sometimes people frequently acknowledge the justice of internal beauty even if they only see one of the numerous virtues, like “Wow she is so virtuous! She is so beautiful internally!” Sounds like people are simply judging you based on complexion again, though not wearing real cosmetics literally. Everyone could be related to one or more of these good characteristics, so does it mean that everyone is beautiful internally? What makes people’s “external appearances” intrigued” is being <strong>natural—relaxed and not pretending to be something different about externality</strong>. That actually means the less attention towards appearance, which is also the origin of other characteristics since in this way people are capable to appreciate something more insightful or important. </p>
<p>As aforementioned, the definition of external beauty is also to <strong>be natural</strong>, which is derived from my own definition of internal beauty. This time “being natural” means <strong>to exist in nature, but not made or caused by humans</strong>. With natural internality, natural externality comes. I always believe that there are tons of ways to make yourself look more attractive, e.g. plastic surgeries, make-ups. But nature shows the real self. That is who you are, really, and everyone should be proud of what they born to be. Reality makes you shine, because you convey sincere pleasure to others. Cosmetics can only boost your “flashy” confidence which is never eternal.</p>
<p>Being nature is the secret of inside-out beauty. The external reality indicates the peace beneath skin where how you look externally is also decided. The definition of beauty is to bring pleasure to people. What nature brings to us is the purest satisfaction. </p>

        <p>I do think that the Kardashians have had a negative influence on beauty standards. The family is adored by many people around the world with labels such as “hot” and “socialite”. Kardashians are frequent social media users which entice young girls to imitate. According to the video, tons of girls cannot conceal their desire to “be a Kardashian”. It seems like Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty magnify these girls’ figure defects which is never something to feel shame about. Kardashians have set girls’ beauty standards away from reality. This would also lead to too many similarities in aesthetics, so Barbie dolls are not for sell anymore—they are everywhere, since girls become Barbies. Besides Kardashians’ unrealistic beauty standards, there are also “consuming” their beauty. They claim that girls all over the world can own the “perfect” figure as themselves by using Kardashians’ products. They are clever—Kardashians utilize girls’ anxiety to make money, and the cost of money makes these girls think that they are doing something meaningful and correct. In this way, the rationality of holding unrealistic beauty standards are corroborated.</p>

        <p>Aristotle once believed that at some places of the world, “the sky was vomiting little bits of flames”. So what are the “flames on sky” exactly? If you look up in North and South poles, nowadays you would still probably see spectacular beautiful lights, especially at nights. These are auroras, also named as polar lights. They are the colored curtains glittering in northern and southern regions of the world. </p>
<p>Some people may get used to calling it “northern lights”. Actually, both North and South pole offer free aurora tickets for tourists. They only differ in names—aurora borealis in the Arctic and aurora australis over its opposite land. Generally, they exceed the Earth’s surface by 80-250 kilometers, which is the height of upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>The oldest record of aurora traces back to Tribal Period of China. The emperor—</p>
<p>Shuan-Yuan’s mother once saw intense lights flowing around Bei-Dou’s constellation. Later, sketch depicted auroras as “clouds with candles burning above”.</p>
<p>So, how is aurora formed? Thanks to our old friend—the sun, people can enjoy such spectacular universal view. Due to the rapid temperature variation, this big radiative star often gives off steady solar wind by bubbling, however there could also be extreme weather. When solar storms approach the Earth, here comes the beginning of universal miracle. According to NASA, solar energy comes into and then reconfigure the magnetic field where tremendous energy is eventually released in forms of electrons and protons. These energetic particles hit and ignite the oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. Usually, red and green auroras are related oxygen while the purple and blue luminous body is nitrogen. Therefore, we can see colorful skies in polar areas. Normally, every 11 years, the spectacle reach the peak. Pathetically, air pollution is affecting global atmosphere. Contemporary luminance falls to the weakest on record according to a senior advisor of NASA. </p>
<p>If you think the Earth is the only wonderland to take a look of polar lights, then you may want to expand your knowledge about the space! The only necessities for an aurora to show up are: solar storm, planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. Up-to-now, scientists have detected auroras over Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. Their colors differ, owing to different compositions of elements in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Astrology researchers are still unsure about whether the phenomenon of aurora exists out of the Solar System. But who can refuse the charm of these mysterious ethereal sky-silks? Let’s hope that one day we can be amazed at the undiscovered polar lights.</p>

        <p>Recently a doctor was detained by police for selling fake drugs to a patient. The patient was suffering from cancer while there were no effective drugs to maintain his health. Reluctantly, the doctor suggested seeking help from India where fake drugs are legal. This is a desperate decision. The doctor knew that fake drugs are not permitted in China. But, in order to save his patient’s life, he decided to take a risk. Dramatically, many people on Weibo started to intercede with the police since what the doctor has done was out of kindness. At last, he is successfully released.</p>
<p>However, according to what is posted on newspaper initially, the doctor is still recognized as a criminal. In this situation, legalization overweighs ethics. So, here comes a dilemma. It is the doctor’s duty to save the patient, but China also forbids fake drugs. I believe the journalism should prefer legalization as a higher code to emphasize China’s legislation. After all, China regards fake drugs as illegal due to its unsafety. It is still unsure whether these low-cost drugs can one-hundred percent benefit the patients or not. And for the ethics part, people online behave rationally—suggest releasing the doctor ethically. In this way, the law is solidified and also people don’t fall the ethics. </p>

        <p><strong>The characters</strong></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> A virtuous girl who would never give up own life facilely.</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> ME’s mother. A great woman who would risk her life to save her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> A girl who named after flowers.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> HYACINTH’s mother. She has low yearly income.</p>
<p><strong>Scene one</strong></p>
<p><em>(The outline of a building is demonstrated in the background. A wall in the middle which separates two families. The furniture and white wall are not shining anymore—big fire is spreading from downstairs. Black smoke is everywhere on stage. A big wooden bookcase is standing in the left corner while the family on the right has a bed placed besides the middle wall. Loads of blood-donation certificates are scattered on nightstand. A bottle of water tips over, spilling water out.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*MOM *trying to find a towel for</em> ME <em>to cover nose. On the other side of the stage,</em> HYACINTH <em>is awakened by stifling toxic gases.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Honey, come this way! <em>(point at the backstage)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(cough)</em> Don’t wait for me! Go! <em>(Fire dances to be a dividing line between</em> MOM <em>and</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p>​    <em>(*HYACINTH *is off the bed, frightened)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> <em>(weep)</em> where are you mama?</p>
<p><em>(*HYACINTH *picks up the bottle and tries to drive away the fire ghost by splashing the tiny amount of water left. However, that only makes herself surrounded by a fire circle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(already near the backstage, wave at</em> ME*)* Come on! Dear!</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(continue coughing)</em> I can’t get to you… </p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *collapses.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> No! Sweetheart!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *maneuvers across the fire wall. Successfully, she gets to her unconscious daughter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Oh, please! <em>(desperate)</em> Wake up! Wake up! <em>(gently and then rapidly shake</em> ME*)*</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> Help! Help! Anymore hear me? Please! <em>(harms around herself)</em></p>
<p><em>(The fire is approaching</em> HYACINTH. She climbs on her bed, although she knows that won’t help either.<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> HELP!!! <em>(kiss ME’s cheek)</em> I won’t leave you. Never.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The fire starts to suffocate</em> MOM*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hard to breathe)</em> You are the most virtuous girl in the world. And I always know that. <em>(tears cannot stop falling down)</em> </p>
<p><em>(Fire is now eating</em> HYACINTH’<em>s pajamas.</em> HYACINTH <em>is threatened into the corner and can no longer struggle anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> I guess this is the end. <em>(grin)</em> Mama, I love you, and I remember to have courage and be kind in my last moment… <em>(weaker and weaker)</em> Forgive *(whisper)*…me…</p>
<p>   <em>(*HYACINTH *is swallowed by fire. She is gone)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(almost faint)</em> Mom is here. <em>(pat</em> ME<em>’s pack)</em> No need to be afraid.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, the bookcase in the corner shakes violently, tending to fall onto the ground. It is heading for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(yell)</em> No!!!!!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *throws herself over ME. The bookcase falls on her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hysterical)</em> Ugh— </p>
<p>   <em>(Her hands drop down slowly from</em> ME<em>’s body.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> (mumble) Hope someone will love you as I do.</p>
<p>​    **(**MOM is dead.)</p>
<p><strong>End of scene one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene two</strong></p>
<p><em>(The background still remains the same. The middle wall disappears. Now we only focus on the family on the left. The furniture has turned into ruins. Beside sparks lies the ember. The bookcase holds its position.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*ME’s fingers *start to move. At first,</em> ME <em>is stuck by something heavy above her.</em> ME <em>musters forces to climb out of the “mountain”.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> What’s so heavy?! <em>(get free eventually)</em></p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *sees</em> MOM <em>not moving anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(joking)</em> Mommy! Don’t imitate me anymore! <em>(smirk)</em> Such a bad day…ok, I’m totally fine now. See? Come on! <em>(baby voice)</em> Hug me! </p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *doesn’t sink into</em> ME<em>’s arms.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Mom! <em>(start to panic)</em> Speak to me! <em>(violently shake the pale body)</em></p>
<p>​    <strong><em>(\</em></strong>ME <em>notices the blood on the back of the head of</em> MOM.<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> NO, no, no, no, no… <em>(Facial expressions are distorted.)</em> </p>
<p>​    <em>(<em>ME</em>’s eyes are dilated with horror. Trembling,</em> ME <em>tests the heartbeat.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(hysterical)</em> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <em>(stumble on</em> MOM*)* NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! <em>(embrace and grovel on</em> MOM<em>’s dead body)</em></p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *walls and weeps for a long time.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(sob)</em> Come back…please…COME BACK!</p>
<p>​    (ME <em>shakes the body again and again. Nothing happens.</em> ME <em>cannot stop crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(convulsive)</em> You said you will always by my side…You…you said you will never let me suffer…You said you are always there to hug me…Why tell the lies, mommy? Why leave me here to suffer alone? I miss the viridescent hyacinths you used for decoration…I miss your kiss…I miss you voice. Come back! Cook breakfast for me! How dare you forget about that? I will die without you. Are you willing to see that? Mom…HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE ON???</p>
<p>​    <em>(The ceiling begins shaking. The building is collapsing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I don’t wanna go…I won’t leave you.</p>
<p>​    <em>(Bricks begins to fall down.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh, no! <em>(astonished)</em> I must leave!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *looks around. Everything is in dust. No cashes. No warm clothes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh my goodness what can depend on?</p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *stares at</em> MOM<em>’s coat.</em> ME <em>hesitates for a while.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Sorry mom.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The whole ceiling begins to fall down.</em> ME <em>takes the coat, with no courage to deliver</em> MOM <em>another glimpse.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>End of scene two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene three</strong></p>
<p><em>(A clammy wind blew up which seems to dim the glittering train station. A luxurious cosmetics store is seated at the right half of the stage with its front door facing the right backstage and backwall halving the stage so that people in the left stage cannot see what happened on the other side at all. A wooden bench covered with fallen leaves is placed in the left half besides the railway. A clock ticktocks in the middle of the background, beneath which a sign reads “Welcome to MOTHERLY STATION</em>—<em>remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart!”)</em></p>
<p><em>(Wearing an ill-fitting coat,</em> ME <em>is frozen up.</em> ME <em>lies on the bench, envious and lonely. Young ladies’ exhilarating laughter lingers around the station.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(weak and pale)</em> There… are… bound <em>(pound the bench with a trembling fist)</em> to be some </p>
<p>methods of getting food money without begging…</p>
<p><em>(Train flashes by.</em> ME <em>had a flash of inspiration.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> No, no it was… <em>(pause)</em> vicious, definitely.</p>
<p><em>(World War III broke out in my brain.)</em></p>
<p><em>(a recording is played at the backstage: “You are such a virtuous girl!”, lingering around the stage.</em> ME <em>heads up instantly with tears and also a sense of guilty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> But… nothing is left for me now, mom… <em>(wipe the tears away)</em> Please forgive me. I don’t </p>
<p>care who I am anymore… I only want to live… on! <em>(firm but struggling)</em> And I would return it </p>
<p>back in the end… The virtuous girl is gone.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *takes out my cellphone slowly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I’m sorry.</p>
<p><em>(Taking a deep breath,</em> ME <em>dials a casual number.</em> <em>“Du—”</em> ME<em>’s cellphone began to alarm.</em> ME <em>looks around nervously, pressing on heart with ragged breathing.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere. It is from the cosmetics store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Umm, I— </p>
<p><em>(A lady steps out of the store reluctantly, clinging on to her muddy cloak which seems to come from the opposite world of the brightly lit luxury store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(whisper)</em> So Sorry. Hang on a second. <em>(turn to the store)</em> I’ve already </p>
<p>told you that I can afford none of these!</p>
<p><em>(*ME *freezes, and then painfully closes eyes in self-accusation while giving</em> <em>herself a slap. But before</em> ME <em>hangs up the phone,</em> MIDDLE-AGED LADY <em>continued—)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(take a deep breath, and grin)</em> Forgive me, dear. You know </p>
<p><em>(optimistic)</em> salesmen can be extremely annoying sometimes. So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(frustrated and guilty)</em> Umm, uh…madam… <em>(inhale deeply)</em> your child is my friend—</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You mean Hyacinth?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(guilty look)</em> S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> I mean, Hyacinth! You definitely know that! What a perfect name! <em>(lost in memory)</em> In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and *(tentative)*—is she at home now?</p>
<p>(Suddenly MIDDLE-AGED LADY falls silent.)</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> No. She is not here.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help! She— <em>(ME have tried best to shout out anxiously.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(decisive)</em> She needs money, right?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(pretend to be steadfast)</em> Yes.</p>
<p>​    <em>(Silence seems like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(ponder)</em> I will definitely give enough money to people in need.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter! </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You know, <em>(suddenly)</em> you must be a virtuous girl, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Not really…</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *nearly cries out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s just a duty to care about minors.</p>
<p><em>(Tears stood in</em> ME<em>’s eyelashes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> If you accept, <em>(step forward)</em> let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *cannot stop crying.</em> ME <em>covered mouth with hands in order to make no sounds while the whole body is rapidly shaking.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(release)</em> Madam! I’m sorry!! What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be <em>(pause)</em> alive. You are the only <em>(snap)</em> person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MIDDLE-AGED LADY *is gratified.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Dear child <em>(chuckle)</em>, This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the “wicked” idea has been defeated by your conscience.</p>
<p><em>(In place of tears, there is the beginning of a smile for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I… <em>(wipe tears away and look gratefully at the black silk sky)</em> appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(pause)</em> She won’t be back.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> How—how can it be?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> She died three days ago. </p>
<p><em>(Silence falls, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(unbelievable)</em> You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. </p>
<p>​    <em>(Pause. They both look up to see the sign.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Of course. <em>(pause)</em> Mommy.</p>
