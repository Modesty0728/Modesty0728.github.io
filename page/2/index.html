        <p>So glad but melancholy to finish our <em>Unwind</em> as the end of term 3… I have learnt so much since the winter holiday, and just watch how many blogs are related to this one…</p>
<p>Before I thought my perspectives are untouchable authorities. Now it is so funny but touching to look back and see how many times my opinions has been beat and then reformed. Mrs. Smith suggested us to be open-minded on the first class starting <em>Unwind</em>. And now I’m proud to tell that I did it. What remains to do is firstly edit my compare and contrast essay, sending it to Mrs. Smith, and most importantly, revise the Unwind Project to make my dream come true. It is the first time that I start to analysis an English novel so deeply and has been provoked so many thoughts towards human nature. But I also suggest myself to improve my reading method due to all the awful quizzes marks. Next time just try not to be so “deeply”… you are just trying to hard…</p>
<p>As a remembrance and enthusiasm, I have started the second book of Unwind series– UnWholly and really found something that made me link back to Unwind. Good luck for the furthermore exploration of Unwind series!</p>

        <p>The universe is infinite and no one is sure about its capacity, but that allows human beings’ wild imagination and exploration. They discover the technology of unwinding and grafting, however their stupidity also grows wildly along with the crazy exploration. Stupidity now does not imply that unwinding is totally absurd. It is suggesting we have been only focusing on what’s the next research to do rather than stopping for a while and reflect on ourselves. Pathetically is we ignore this suggestion, our stupidity turns infinite. I believe the author is just reflecting on what happens in the book. People make a compromise between pro-life and pro-choice, but they never stop to think further…</p>

        <p><strong>Graveyard: unusable planes are stored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another figurative meaning by using this as the final destinations of the Unwinds.</strong></p>
<p>I do think it is a profound choice to make Graveyard the final destination.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s irony here. The introduction of Part5 says, “Graveyard is not a land where abandoned planes piled up”. Unwinds here actually have something to do and the abandoned planes here are in symbolism of them. It emphasizes that the Unwinds’ final destination won’t be nothing but waiting for death. They are going to prove themselves meaningful.</p>
<p>Moreover, “keep active aircraft flying” refers to using effective parts to fix an aircraft. I think it is implying the intension of the Admiral to save the Unwinds from being into pieces and ensure their safety. </p>

        <p>I wouldn’t purchase a “human soul” even though it really exists. First of all, I have no intension to buy a soul which is useless to me. Moreover, people can never purchase a priceless product, just like a soul. If everyone tries to buy a soul, this pure, intangible substance will become cheap and vulnerable. The soul offers someone life and thoughts. If it is shared by others, no one’s life is completed then.</p>

        <p>I think this piece of part3 introduction is quite interesting and thought-provoking. It is related to BBC so what happens makes me empathetic and uncomfortable because it seems related to our real life. </p>
<p>And the author included this is not only because of it reflects the main topic of unwinding and dystopia. In the end of report, something familiar is mentioned: “It could possibly be a result of harvesting stem cells from bone marrow.” I can recall the depictions towards Cy-Fi ‘s experience of receiving lobe, which causes trouble of being controlled later on. So perhaps this piece of report suggests us considering the importance of brain and whether it is a wise choice to provide every organ to recipients. I think he is trying to tell us: unwinding is causing trouble.</p>

        <p><strong>What do the quotes by the two nurses teach you about human nature?</strong></p>
<p>It tells me that the human nature is highly related to the law. The change of law regulates and sometimes limits our behaviors and that’s why most people’s human nature is gradually changing over a long period due to fully obeying the law. However, this kind of change in human nature would definitely change the law again since people and the law both demonstrates same purpose.   Thus, the human nature that changes the law is clearly against it and is much stronger than the previous one because it is influential enough to change human nature and therefore the law.</p>

<p>“this isn’t a perfect world” mean s we cannot consider something something completely right or wrong and everything is too complex to give a simple and hasty definition. But “people who think it is” are exactly the ones who are narrow-minded or not critically thinking. Actually there’s no definite difference between black and white because they can be exchanged, which is the secret of the world. People who cannot realize it are someone unclear about this world, living without a clear mind.</p>

        <p><strong>What was something  that surprised you while looking at the world laws of abortion map, why? explain. Why is it important that we respect each other’s perspectives or values even if it does not match our own?</strong></p>
<p>For the first question, what has surprised me while looking at the map is the big total number of all the countries  which allow abortion totally. And also in the introduction of the purpose of the map, it indicates the desire to “advance abortion rights as human rights for women and girls around the globe”, which  also demonstrates it is on the pro-choice side. In my opinion, children are not pets of mothers and they do not have to accept anything that their mothers ask them to do. In other words, children are born their own rights to live that no one, including their mothers is reasonable to ignore their rights so the statistics and explanation really surprise me. And for the second question, it is important that we respect others just because everyone is equal. We all respect our own perspectives and values and so do others. That’s why we need to be respectful to protect everyone that is as equal as you are.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I finished my mid-term drama duet performance–pretty girl/plain girl. It’s quite touching and dramatic to recall my previous fear towards drama in the beginning of the term. I really need to be confident–always feel frustrated and anxious during rehearsal… oh I wouldn’t get out of my comfort zone! oh I’m acting so bad! oh tomorrow I would fail everyone! But I’m proved to be excellent! To my great surprise, nearly every peer was so amazed and shocked by my acting that they said ‘’You are already a superstar in Hollywood!” “You’ve completed a miracle!” Therefore I believe I really have done a great job. It is so amazing that I can exactly do those silly stuff that I dare not to imagine before. But what this experience impresses most is that it prove my hard work meaningful. All the frustration was not because of my really bad work, but the intention to behave perfect. Thanks to drama, I’ve been out of my comfort zone for so many times only in this term! I can conspicuously feel my great progress and developed confidence. Can you imagine that? I was even nervous during verbal presentation and felt so embarrassed when doing movements in front of the class. I think my present results greatly prove my great efforts–99% in GPA, 28/30 for pantomiming… Now I really feel confident in drama. It is not over confidence. It is my efforts that build up my confidence.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Surprise! Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! I’m Modesty Zhou from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China who is remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite book! It is so exhilarating to show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I am when reading Roland’s unwinding part— the most shocking episode of this book for sure!! “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman I see myself: lay in the bed, overwhelmed with the flood of grievances and passion. No one came to comfort me. I was on fire… my limbs would soon burn out! It felt like squeezing a sponge… Fury fled out so I continue squeezing even though the sponge has been compressed into the size of nail. At that time fire spread out wildly, from skin to heart… from mind to nowhere… rage began to retaliate— ha, you, no place to burden me right? Then I would invade your soul… we will see the depth of your soul… Fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should have been turned into ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Generally, I <strong>understand</strong> every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I can almost see a little soft baby in cradle with heart on <strong>fire</strong>… can you imagine that— the purest creature in the world versus “natural demon”— lullaby versus disaster… How could I ever abhor Roland anymore after “experiencing” his real life? Oh Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> <strong>feeling</strong> I had. Now a tragic Unwind “visualizes” my hidden pain…and everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the despair in Roland’s heart… We are not the same, but here is the magic of reading: maybe you only see a piece of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that person…and you are exactly <strong>that person</strong>! The sense of empathy is now intensified which is the distillation of the overlapped life traces.</p>
<p>​    By the way your language can be so entertaining sometimes that brings fresh fragrance to adjust the stifling atmosphere, just as lively kids. I love this one so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and even smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed (honestly most parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy…), half fruity. </p>
<p>Speaking of the language and content, I must emphasize my enthusiasm towards Part 2 which impresses me so much that it tastes like Christmas frosting which gives the favors an intensely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time! That is owing to the insightful “philosophies” in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what Part 2 attracts me most is how deeply it leads me to “dive” into the reflection towards <strong>human nature</strong>. Your novel shows me a brand-new world, profound but yet amazing, and more surprisingly connects with my other studies— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc. <em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory characteristics. We cannot fully value Macbeth as evil, since he may really become a brave hero if his assassination succeeds. But before assassinations, Macbeth has already suffered the torment of conscience… Perhaps everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it is just implying the struggle of human nature rather than our fault. It is not the neutralization of bad and good that makes us extraordinary— it is the courage to <strong>choose</strong> to leave the dark side. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the choosing test would be eventually sent to everyone. They are less likely to find their real selves undoubtedly…Oh and this one confuses me for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.</em> I once felt Nurse Greta was indifferent and marble-hearted to say such words. Nevertheless, Connor ironically receives an arm from Rolland in the end. I began to consider whether unwinding is <strong>that</strong> wrong… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds… That feeling is as complex as our attitude towards the water— it may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> provides readers with a free secret garden to “think, think, think” about ourselves, and about the world. People have intense discussions for “soul” and “human nature” topics. The questions you raised up permit myself to also contribute a “thoughtful” voice which may even help in some ethical fields— who knows whether designer babies would cause troubles in the future…</p>
<p>I do think <em>Unwind</em> demonstrates the reality of the changing human nature. Lev’s transformation is conspicuous. When I first went through Connor’s story in the very beginning of the novel, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I register Connor’s slight changes imply that he is not brave or impulsive all the way. He had been intimidated by the prospect. And actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. Some Unwinds’ tough exteriors hide a sensitive and vulnerable soul… Courage makes us strong, but its developing process starting from fragility makes us outstanding. Wow, sounds so familiar… you know it is so amazing to gain the same perspective from different contents! </p>
<p>After reading, I’m also eager to ask some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave <em>Unwind</em> an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Dramatically… I’ve been affirming that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side because most parts focus on how the Unwinds fight against the Order. However, as aforementioned, now I realize that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you (sorry for offending) write more supporting lines for the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Maybe your neutral stance is clear in the aforementioned “perfect world theory”? That would make more sense… but still why did you create such a dystopian world if pro-choice side is also quite reasonable? Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always intends to “set Lev free”? It’s quite puzzling to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believe Pastor Dan is waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But at the end of the novel he says he still keeps his faith… so if he never believes in “a god who condones human tithing”, why did he brainwash Lev with tithing ideas? Meanwhile if he believes in that god, why did he entice Lev to run away? The figure of God in Pastor Dan’s mind may be changing all the time…?</p>
<p>“Lilies smell worse than weeds when they rot.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said when they bloom.”</p>
<p>You can never imagine how much I start to think about the human nature… let’s hope that what happens in <em>Unwind</em> would never come true in the reality. Thank you so much for offering me the novel as a key to the exploration of human nature.</p>
