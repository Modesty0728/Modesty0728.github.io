        <p>It depends. People from distinct religions and regions are supporting heterogeneous beauty standards. The same fact is—people are always chasing for beauty, because nearly everyone wants to have a not-so-bad look. And that is normal, very common based on human nature. So, if we only consider the perfect beauty standards, the health and beauty industry are safe, since these represent people’s nature of admiring beauty and their ideal figures. However, what we are concerning now is the methods used to approach these standards. Friends around me would instinctively laugh at my relevantly darker skin, frequently going on diets, and even plan carefully for a future plastic surgery. I’ve always been confused. Instinctively I cannot help but disapproving their manners. But why? I mean—everyone has their rights to chase for beauty, so is this also their right to take any extreme ways to achieve their goals? Maybe it is. So why am I denying their legitimate decisions? Perhaps it is due to my instinct to stick up for “natural beauty”. I even get uncomfortable when seeing my friends infatuated with make-ups. I’ve reflected on myself for so many times. Don’t be so extreme! Don’t be so harsh on your friends if yourself do not like it! You have to understand it is others’ right! Besides, even myself once planned to purchase a bunch of Dior or Channel’s cosmetics when growing into an adolescent. Literally, I enjoyed considering about that kind of thing! That made me feel confident, as if my life was extremely colorful. I can only tell that like me, preferring nature can refer to less care in personal appearance (well I still make sure that I’m in a tidy and easeful look). It is really hard for me to answer whether striving to be pretty by using whatever possible methods is correct and rational. I can only say that there is sequential safe level for health and beauty industry. The more thoughts you put on this field, the more “risks” you are likely to take since you’ve put too much precious energy on superficial fantasy. Deep down, infinite emptiness is out of ignorance because you are not living for yourself anymore but your appearance.</p>

        <p>\1.   Main clash</p>
<p>l <strong>Safety issue</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear actually indicates the least security risks.</p>
<p>You would say that we cannot ignore a single possibility, since 1% possibility can cause irreversible health damage to living beings.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt;Rebuttal:</strong></p>
<p>the possibility of being involved in a car accident is much higher than nuclear leak.</p>
<p>Question: <em>So, do you want to change a topic? What about this one: would FP risk their lives to take a bus?</em></p>
<p><strong>Only if there is 1% possibility to be risky in safety industry, the “1% possibility” is not concerning.</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Culture issue</strong></p>
<p>When we decide to build nuclear power plants in FP nations, we would worry about their culture heritage spontaneously. It is a concerning issue indeed. It is something we need to think and worry about. We need to build the sense to protect their culture and then make our determination visible. How? Through government legislation. <strong>But that’s not what we can worry about. Now the environmental department needs to get in charge and carry one our resolution.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>-&gt;Rebuttal:</strong> </p>
<p>If you are so active caring about the loss of native culture, ok <strong>your battle target is the environmental department of the government, not us.</strong> When we come to the disappear of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which one is to blame: the pilot, or the Wright brothers? Similarly, are we the ones to blame?</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear power plants are not responsible for protecting native culture.</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Economy issue</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear plants require lower cost. </p>
<p>-&gt;In this way, benefit national economy.</p>
<p>-&gt;better protection</p>
<p><strong><em>if\</em></strong> <em>you question whether the money would be used on protection project,</em> (I can tell you that whether or not to do so is also related to legislation rather than the construction of plants. if you wanna get into the topic of legislation, infinite questions would follow, and I bet you can answer none of them) <em>Why don’t you ask more questions like “whether the legislators are holding justice?”, or “will the legislator use the money to buy thousands of hamburgers if they are starving?”</em></p>
<p>l <strong>Environment issue</strong></p>
<p>Without nuclear energy, FP do continuous logging. And that is so beneficial to the environment! FP should be thankful for being offered a convenient chance of using nuclear energy</p>
<p>\2.   Location necessary </p>
<p>è <strong>Near sea</strong></p>
<p>!! We need <strong>tons of cold water</strong> to cool down the fuel rods inside the nuclear reactors</p>
<p>*世界超半数所有核反应堆都在海边，不在海边的周围也有大量水源。</p>
<p>*日本核泄漏后导致爆炸的主要原因就是<strong>未及时注入冷水，可见cool water的重要性！！</strong></p>
<p>！！wind energy: toxic gases dissipate in the atmosphere (苏联切尔诺贝利事件有毒粉尘飘到了瑞典)</p>
<p>è <strong>Remote</strong></p>
<p>Everyone is equal indeed. So, which one means less damage: kill one person or kill a country of person?</p>
<p>-&gt;I know you would say, “what happened in Japan indicates that the damage is going to people around the world, not just the people living near plants!”</p>
<p>   -&gt;ok, so you are even confused about the basic facts: Japanese could totally choose to bury those waste water deep down into ground, which is one of the two ways of dealing with nuclear leak (another one is discharging it into ocean) Japan chose the former due to the latter’s huge opportunity cost. </p>
<p>\3.  direct benefits to FP</p>
<p>l <strong>Modernization</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Offer working opportunities (job)</strong></p>

        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile. However, Risa and Connor seem to come from two planets more often than not— “isolation” and “separateness” are conspicuous. So, is it only their common goal of staying alive that binds them? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? Through thorough reading, it is not hard to register that the affection between Risa and Connor springs up owing to both their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>One of Risa and Connor’s “few” similarities is the perfect interpretation of the Admiral’s supreme rules—especially for “rise to the occasion”. The duo head for a bus stop tacitly at the instant when a police car appears, which indicates that they have been “molded” into coherent “underground workers”, and meanwhile are flexible enough to utilize surroundings as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Comparatively, the couple’s escaping plan is also coolly probative. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing back cops, followed by rushing onto the interstate. Risa does the same except for the details— her destination is a forest and there’s no one blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In these cases, they are both holding abundant intention towards surviving, so even though chances come in a hurry that could simultaneously wither away, they will succeed to grab it. Clearly, Risa and Connor are naturals in finding out the first priority, which makes them “excellent” AWOLs. This facilitates the first step of love—mutual appreciation.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that the lovers have grown fearless. Back to the days at State Home, Risa shuddered when being order to “satisfy” budget cuts, almost involuntarily asking for other professions. Similarly, Connor needed Ariana to light up his courage when facing the danger of unwinding. they were too intimidated by the prospect compared with what happens to them later: Risa becomes a pianist in Happy Jack Harvest Camp while Connor ultimately walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Having gone through so many life and death tests, now they take it easy. At least they have tried, leaving no regret. Risa and Connor stand the test of time so a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are truly ready for love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will their emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Well, they own distinct characteristics. It is like a battle between ice and fire when referring to “rational versus emotional”. Connor constantly causes trouble as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Conversely his girlfriend is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland—even after the “Bathroom Event”. She is also sober enough to scan the danger of taking that new-born baby and then try her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like whether diverse emotions can be effectively controlled or not is the key difference between the couple, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, their characteristics gradually interweave afterwards— Risa begins to care about Connor instead of keeping distance, and Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they growing more and more intimate with each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t mean “identical”. The similarities between couples can only get them qualified and prepared for love. Tried-and-true love will appear only if both sides build a bridge over any existing gap, since that demonstrates great efforts for love, rather than illusion of romance. Between Risa and Connor love obtains the sublimation and the eternal.</p>

        <ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a supporting character in Disney’s story <em>Cinderella</em>, the physical embodiment of hope. I am Cinderella’s godmother. I always appear suddenly in the thin air with twinkling lights (sparkly confetti), wearing a gown with two wings shaking behind her back and a wand (can be summoned from nothingness) at the end of which is grafted a shiny tin foil star. I’m so warm-hearted that I could not bear any unfair. So, I offer poor Cinderella a little bit of help…make her princess dream come true: a dress and a tiara. In fairy tales, I’m “a fairy with magical powers who acts as a mentor or parent to someone, in the role that an actual godparent was expected to play in many societies.” I stand for children’s fantasies about magic, and “whenever events are right for a fairy tale to recur, I steps in to make sure that the tale in question runs its course with as few fatalities as possible.” I wouldn’t appear to Ella if she loses her faith. Actually, I did not appear until Cinderella was at her weakest point. So, I won’t offer my help casually. I would only appear if Ella keeps a kind heart, which is strong enough to summon me, and just need a little bit of magic to push her to what she deserves. I like magic, Cinderella’s happiness, and books. What I dislike are hopelessness, unhappiness, and losing my wand! And I’m always in an active status. My wand holds incredible power, such as metamorphosis and the ability to warp reality among others. However, its magic is not exclusive to me as mortals can also use it (can be either good or evil however). However, despite my sweetness I do not sympathize with those who are unforgiving towards others. I also have a connection with my wand (they call it “telepathy”).</p>
<h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Disney film version, although I would suddenly appear in the thin air, I’m always watching Cinderella secretly, caring about her and her original family (Ella’s parents both are gone now). But when Ella summons me, I would come to her wherever she is.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Twinkling lights (sparkly confetti) is always surrounding me when I show up out of thin air. Besides, Cinderella is with me, together with two white horses, a driver, a footman, and a carriage which are produced by me.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the evening. After Cinderella’s abusers left. Before the ball gets started.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m equipped with a magical wand. I was appointed be to Cinderella’s fairy godmother. I am summoned by Cinderella since she hasn’t lost her faith even when she is at her weakest point.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m Cinderella’s godmother. As a fairy godmother, I am also children’s beacon of hope.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want Cinderella to go to the ball. I want Cinderella happy. I want Cinderella to always keep her faith.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>My precious wand can also be used by bad people. When magic is used as dark force, I would probably lose my job!! And the whole world would get messed up.  So, my wand is my pressure, but also my obstacle as well. What’s more, I only have the magic to show up out of the air and summon my wand without using my pressure. Besides this obstacle, I also “tend to be comically absent-minded, continuously loses sight of the obvious, and has a habit of both losing her wand and forgetting her magic words “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo">Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo</a>“.</p>
<p>Cinderella’s abusers are also big obstacles. They oppress my dear girl and nearly ruin my contribution and Ella’s sweet future in the last minute.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>To get Ella happier, I show up in time to offer her nice dress. Being aware of the stepmother’s selfishness, I was overt to make a pair of magical glass slippers as a back-up plan…and that is eventually proved to be profound and significant. </p>

        <p>Today Kristen and I have grouped and started searching materials. From researching on Internet and using our common sense, up to now we have come up with 7 different materials. The first one, which is the one we both first came up with, is bubble wrap. Since “pod” is not allowed, we need something to protect egg’s movement. Bubble wrap is definitely a good choice because it is light, protectable, and provided egg with larger space. Then I thought that something that protects the eggs most efficiently is definitely hens. So I suggested creating a “fake hen”…however just a imagination. Hard to get it come true. Kristen also came up with a creative idea–use soda and Mentos to create foam and gas that can send the egg safely to the ground. However we believed Mrs. K would allow any on-the-ground equipment. Soda suggested using non-Newtonian fluid which would be “stronger” if you squeeze it harder, so that the fluid can provide us with flexible egg wrapping shapes, but be tough and strong while hitting the ground. I also think about other possible materials like silicone, and I would put that into final consideration. After all the ideas shared, we ask help from the internet. There’s a popular method–a triangle brace made by straws which fixes the egg in the center. But that would probably be a “pod” or the egg would fall off. Some foreigners also use a barrel of popcorns to prevent their baby eggs from breaking apart, but popcorns may disappoint the mass part. And the non-Newtonian fluid may miss the “most spectacular” shoot.</p>

        <p>This week I was troubled by the Drama monologue performance. I portrayed Nicole Kidman’s monologue in the film <em>Stoker</em> which is called Evelyn. However, I really found it hard to get into that situation. I’m always proud of myself for my empathy. I can always comprehend others no matter what that man has done. But I always act as if I get OCD… I would think a lot, forcing myself to feel the atmosphere again and again. I do can understand stand by Evelyn’s side and think like her, but the more I push myself, the more I get sucked into the no-tear situation. Really to my surprise, I did cry out one time during my rehearsal. At that time I really felt of myself. The tears just came down naturally, standing on my eyelashes cannot stop themselves fall down. But I never got that good feeling anymore…even in my final monologue performance. I cannot help but feel ashamed and melancholy. In order to get myself into it, I recall all the sadness from the past…and all day around I also felt melancholy…and agitated for my inability. I have talked to Mrs. Smith about my difficulty. She definitely agree with me. And she told me that I have put too much stress on myself. I shouldn’t consider it as a pressure. If I can consider it as pleasure and enjoy it, pushed by enthusiasm rather than GPA, I would absolutely feel less stressful. After all, even best actresses cannot forget about themselves and fully understand the character all the time. I’m not a pro, and I’ve already done a great job. So just enjoy it. And do not care about the grades anymore.</p>
<p>The mid-term report card is also delivered. Previously I would feel anxious when hearing others’ better grades…but now I’m behaving more modestly. I can now persuade myself to focus on myself  more easily. Besides, I was studying 3 AP courses…I should be confident, but modest, and keep going, that’s it. Just be patient. Study happily, and bright future would follow.</p>

        <p>\1.   WHO AM I?</p>
<p>Satine is a dancer and courtesan, who is known as the legendary “sparkling Diamond”. She has to hide her deep love to Christian in order to protect Moulin Rouge from the Duke. She is lack of freedom since she can never choose who to love. She finally dies due to Tuberculosis.</p>
<p>\2.   WHERE I AM?</p>
<p>Satine is in Paris, France. And her affiliation is Moulin Rouge. Satine is actually the star of Moulin Rouge</p>
<p>\3.   WHAT SURROUNDS ME?</p>
<p>Work in Moulin Rouge so work together with Zidler (owner of Moulin Rouge and friend)’s “Diamond Dog Dancers”. Also surrounded by the audience who are always watching her performance. However, because she is the “Sparkling Diamond” which means that she is outstandingly beautiful, there are always a bunch of men around her, like the duke and Christian who Satine falls in love with. Some of them are not glad experiences… for instance, the duke actually plagues Satine much for blocking the love between Satine and Christian. Her surroundings actually put a huge impact on her. She has no right to decide who to love and whether to be healthy. People around her make all the decisions for her. So, this question is actually pathetic for Satine, for this tragedy.</p>
<p>\4.   WHAT TIME IS IT?</p>
<p>In the early year 1990.</p>
<p>\5.   WHAT ARE MY CIRCUMSTANCES?</p>
<p>Satine is the star courtesan at Moulin Rouge. Her collapsing onto floor during performance has already given us a hint of her illness. Satine succumbs to tuberculosis eventually. Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she told him to write their story.</p>
<p>\6.   WHAT ARE MY RELATIONSHIPS?</p>
<p>Satine’s true lover is Christian. She actually gets friends at Moulin Rouge, like her boss Zidler. Abd also she is forced to have a relationship with duke who does want to own her although Satine herself does not love him at all. She is admired by loads of men due to her pretty appearance.</p>
<p>\7.   WHAT DO I WANT?</p>
<p>Satine definitely wants freedom and love. All the decisions about her are made by people around her and she cannot love someone that is disapproved of her boss.</p>
<p>\8.   WHAT IS MY OBSTACLE?</p>
<p>Satine’s obstacle are all the people around her and her own identity. She cannot fall in love with anymore, which is claimed by herself. She does love Christian, but their love cannot be discovered or Moulin Rouge would be in danger. The Duke is the big obstacle, but that also reflects that the biggest obstacle is her identity and the society.</p>
<p>\9.   WHAT DO I DO TO GET WHAT I WANT?</p>
<p>Although Satine is in great fear of her love being discovered by the duke, Christian and she actually are brave enough to interact with each other under the duke’s nose. Her great courage and the eager towards true love offer her short experience of romance. Satine is brave enough to express herself.</p>

        <ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am Evelyn, a housewife with perfect posture. I’m distant from my daughter India and my husband Richard. I’m quite jealous about the bond between Richard and India as they go hunting together all day and what I only can do is to get their preys stored. I’m alcoholic. Actually, drinking helps me escape from life and the jealousy. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>Always at my big house, with Stokers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>A luxury house. Loads of servants. My daughter India is always with me although keeping distance with me. My husband leaves me but his brother Charlie comes who lets me feel the sense of romance once again.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know…</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I lose my husband on my daughter India’s 18th birthday. It was a great shock… however, I am an unstable woman, and the sudden presence of my husband Richard’s brother—Charlie is much to my delight! Charlie recalls my memory of young Richard. Gradually, Charlie and me grow intimate as India refuses to get rid of melancholy and relax. Actually, my daughter is so distant…You know, it is just because I’m so lonely deep down and find it hard to get close to Stokers. I admit that I am just vulnerable like other woman, eager to get my husband’s company and love. On a beautiful evening, India’s great aunt Gwendolyn makes a visit to our house which is very much to my dismay. She suggests me to pay attention to Charlie and once again speaks of my dead husband Richard. I was flattered by the emerging romance so ignored what she was saying and was sensitive and a little bit guilty when my husband was mentioned… But all of that does not influence my more and more intensified feeling for Charlie at all. So, can you ever imagine how astonished it is to witness my own daughter grows closer to Charlie and eventually intimate? My heart is full of hatred. I burnt out everything from my husband and the preys hunted by my daughter, and then coldly expresses the desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie. I have already “realized” what happened to India’s big aunt and Mrs, McGarrick. I only ask for Charlie to get my daughter go. But once again, I’m totally intrigued by Charlie’s charm and he tries to seduce me with his belt suddenly! He calls India to come here, and my dear daughter is with a rifle. I thought she would kill me…but Charlie is shot.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>India is the daughter if Richard and me although both of them seem distant from me. The appearance of Richard’s brother Charlie makes me satisfied since for the first time India can never steal love from me anymore. Later, I do find Charlie suspicious, but his great charm still steals away my ration.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I always want to be cared and loved by the man. I want to get closer to my husband and daughter. I want to get back to the time that Richard is still intimate with me. Later on, after discovering the relationship between Charlie and India, I want India, my own daughter, to suffer. In the end, I want Charlie to stay away from India.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>My husband leaves me so there’s no chance to rebuild our relationship again. My daughter is absolutely a “Stoker”. The stokers enjoy the satisfaction of killing, which makes it impossible for me to get closer to them. And for my wish to let India suffer…I do hate her for what she has done…what I still love her. India is my hope. She is the reason why I had a child. I want to utilize her to improve my relationship with my husband. And what kind of person Charlie really is rejects my hope towards love.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to get closer to my husband, I had a child. And to be loved and accompanied by a man, I build up a close relationship to Charlie. In the end, I try to warn Charlie to get away from my daughter by talking and warning.</p>

        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as the nineteenth century, feeding and experimenting on pigeons which were selected according to individual traits (Hooper, 2017). Obviously, human beings have been exploring this field for centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting to the environment, normally the advantageous living beings would be chosen to provide people with a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection of which “genetic materials are artificially manipulated” according to the definition of GMO. In other words, GMOs are created “against nature”. Our research focuses on the first consuming-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon) created by AquaBounty Technologies (Nordrum, 2020).</p>
<p>This biotechnology enlarges salmon’s size (comparatively a doubled size in a certain growing period), and the time they take to grow to market size is halved compared with conventional Atlantic salmon which are definitely slow growers with a 32 to 36 months’ life circle approximately (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). </p>
<p>So far, only a few countries have been using this method to improve salmon’s quality, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon came down in pike in 1989, Canada, which could grow all year around rather than just in spring and summer (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). On November 19th, 2015, with food and environmental safety both ensured, AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon came into season with the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon. </p>
<p>So, what are the details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon are originally Atlantic salmon inserted another two special genes from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Ocean Pout. Generally, the scientists transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs. Therefore, the original (Atlantic) ones manage to grow faster in warmer seawater. All ultimate products are sterile females (The Fish Site, 2010), which directly diminishes the concern of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with disapprovals based on salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, it has been backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that GM salmon are domesticated (The Fish Site, 2010). Current results also indicate that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors” because of the low quantity requirement of food resources. However, although it finally became true that FDA approved the GM salmon, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) refuse to have GM salmon sold in their stores (Shreeves, 2019) as GMO labels are never required on AquaBounty Salmon—consumers could be unaware of the particularity of what they have just eaten. It is also being said that AquAdvantage salmon contain less nutrient—“producing less of the beneficial omega—3 fatty acids than non-GMO salmon” (<em>Say NO to GMO Salmon + Full-Length Feature Online: Salmon Confidential</em>, 2013). There are worries based on the survival of wild animals and human health indeed, but undeniably AquAdvantage salmon benefit the environment. For instance, they actually improve the conservation of wild fish populations. As aforementioned, the demand for food decreases. That sustains the aquaculture effectively. Moreover, where GM salmon are bred is very close to the grocery store, which lowers carbon emissions during transportation. AquaBounty is also perfectly capable of recycling waste water and resources (<em>Nine Things You Need To Know About GMO Salmon</em>, n.d.). </p>
<p>“GMOs” has always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about its pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new genetic product came out, and how scientists argue, raising up questions, analyzing, researching…We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are relatively friendly to the earth. No matter what would happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate and continue the great efforts put in this field which promote the development of genetics.</p>
