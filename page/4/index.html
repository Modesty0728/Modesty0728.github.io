        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile. However, they seem to come from two planets more often than not— “isolation” and “separateness” are conspicuous. So, is it only their common goal of staying alive that binds them? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Through reading *Unwind*, it is not hard to register that the affection between Risa and Connor springs up owing to both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Risa and Connor’s “few” similarities is the perfect interpretation towards the Admiral’s supreme rules—especially for “rise to the occasion”.</strong> The duo head for the bus stop tacitly at the instant when a police car appears, which indicates that they have been molded into coherent “fighting” forces that keep “running will attract attention” in mind, and meanwhile flexible enough to utilize surroundings as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Comparatively, the couple’s escaping plan is also coolly probative. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing back cops, followed by rushing onto the interstate while Risa is the same except the details that her destination is a forest and there’s no one blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In these cases, they are holding wild intension towards surviving, so when the chance comes in a hurry that could simultaneously wither away, they succeed to grab it. Clearly, Risa and Connor are naturals in finding out the first priority, which makes them excellent AWOLs. This facilitates the first step of love—mutual appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>It is also very explicit to notice that the lovers both have grown fearless, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding.</strong> Risa shuddered when being order to “satisfy” budget cuts, almost involuntarily asking for other professions. Moreover, she was ashamed for current identity so hid and made it up on the transition bus. Similarly, Connor needed Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind”. Connor and Risa were too intimidated by the prospect compared with what happens on them later: in Happy Jack Harvest Camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor ultimately walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Having gone through a bunch of life and death tests, now they take it easy. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are ready for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p><strong>Well, they own distinct characteristics.</strong> <strong>It is like a battle between ice and fire when referring to “rational versus emotional”.</strong> Connor constantly causes trouble as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Conversely Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland—even after the “Bathroom Event”. She is also sober enough to scan the danger of taking that new-born baby and then try her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like whether their diverse emotions can be effectively controlled or not is the couple’s key difference and therefore their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins to care about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t mean “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them prepared and qualified for love. Tried-and-true love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over any existing gap, since that demonstrates great efforts for love, rather than illusion of romance. Between Risa and Connor love obtained the sublimation and the eternal.</p>

        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”. Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins caring about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Head, Face, &amp; Neck</p>
<p>l <strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>I can exactly use the depiction from the original to describe Scarlett in the movie— “The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.” Scarlett has got a pair of eyes for story-telling, and has so much life that she rolls eyeballs frequently and her eyebrows are always dancing. The pursing of lips and exuded “grievance” in face both prove Scarlett a “skilled flirt”. Generally, Scarlett always wears exaggerated, lovely, and piteous expressions which fills men with protectiveness towards her.</p>
<p>l <strong>Make and appreciate eye contact.</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett is often over-confident and remains ambivalent towards men. The reason Scarlett is so attractive to them is that her lovely green eyes can took men’s soul which is like a hook attaching to their heart. Imagine such a charming girl are gazing at you while offering an arresting grin.</p>
<p>l <strong>Tend to smile, but then smirk</strong></p>
<p>Before the break out of Civil War, Scarlett’s smile is naïve, genuine, and flirtatious. However, having gone through parents’ passing away and several bad-ending marriages, she is just like the flower flying in the wind, catering to the request of world and life. The facial is not as lively as before: the size of smile is gradually fixed.</p>
<p>Upper body: </p>
<p>l <strong>Upright posture, like a princess</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett always has her arms bent in front of body to lift dress with head lordly raised up, which is almost the same compared with the depiction from the original— “The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.”</p>
<p>l <strong>Active gestures &amp; touches</strong></p>
<p>When meeting men, Scarlett always offer her hands directly for a kiss and sometimes point at them saucily.</p>
<p>l <strong>Extremely shallow &amp; deep breaths</strong></p>
<p>Normally, Scarlett looks as if she is not breathing at all, which may benefit from the good education as a lady. However, it is also very apparent that stress or fear can also intensify her breaths greatly. In this case, Scarlett acts as if she will suffer a split-second faint.</p>
<p>Lower body:</p>
<p>l <strong>light on her feet</strong></p>
<p>As Melanie says, “Oh Scarlett, you have so much life.” Scarlett is light-footed like a little cat. However, she stumbles from the stairs later, which leads to a miscarriage.</p>
<p>l <strong>Quick and saucy movements</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett always acts as if she is in a rush to a ball. But later on, I realized that she gets a short temper which I associate with pepper.t</p>
<p>l <strong>Walk heel-first</strong></p>
<p>Although Scarlett is always releasing her charm intentionally, she seems full of confidence and her steps are full of strength. Clearly she is a remarkably adroit and determined woman.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Part FIVE:</strong></p>
<p>u Why has the author included the list of the Admiral’s rules in this chapter?</p>
<p>\1. <strong>Introduce ten supreme rules to help readers know more about the Admiral.</strong> The second and fourth demands clarifies— “SURVIVING HAS EARNED YOU THE RIGHT TO BE RESPECTED” “YOUR LIFE IS MY GIFT FOR YOU. TREAT IT LIKE ONE.”, which demonstrate his respect to the Unwinds and human nature and even makes him sound like a pro-life warrior in the previous war… Also, rule No. 3, No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8, reflects the Admiral’s traits of responsible and strict. He actually “governs” graveyard coherently.</p>
<p>\2. In the context, some of the demonstrated rules are combined with the depiction of Unwinds’ interpretation. So the separated rule construction can sometimes be a <strong>generalization of what’s exactly going on on the graveyard.</strong></p>
<p>\3. Clearly, the demonstration of rules gives a quick <strong>preview of the Connor and Risa’s current living model and offers an environment or structure for the happen of coming events.</strong> </p>
<p>u How has Shusterman made the Admiral seem mysterious? What do we find out later about that particular mystery?</p>
<p>\1. Firstly, <strong>the Admiral’s words</strong> make him seem mysterious. When Connor asks “Who are you, exactly?”, he clarifies nothing but his identity of a former admiral of the United States Navy. Also, from <strong>the Unwinds impression towards him</strong>. (a. In the book, the Unwinds register the Admiral’s motivation as secret as his name. All the new coming Unwinds are curious about their governor here.</p>
<p>(b. Risa recognizes the Admiral’s war uniform, but is confused about whether is came from the pro-life or pro-choice side. That would definitely make his seem mysterious because neither side won or came up with the idea of “unwind”. Also, the wild spread out of rumors towards the Admiral also adds to his mystery.</p>
<p>   \2. The Admiral’s perfect teeth same as the boy in the photo are actually dentures. And the boy is his own son rather than some Unwind from which the Admiral took teeth away. The reason those teeth look so similar is that the Admiral’s dentures record is utilized. However, there’s something true about the rumor: the boy is unwound thanks to the Admiral indeed.</p>
<p>u What does Risa say the Admiral has done for her? Why is this important to her?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Risa says that the Admiral has given her back her right to exist.</strong> The “legal” occupation he offers adds to Risa’s security and she gradually gets along with her new life.</p>
<p>\2.   (a. It helps Risa live <strong>happies and more relaxed</strong>. The Admiral gives her a shelter place and a promise for life. That finally get Risa start to enjoy and stop being concern about her life. The job also fills her day and mind, which turns her life meaningful and peace. After all, Risa don’t need to worry about the horrible result of behaving badly. Gradually she forms a more concentrated and peaceful mind that allows Risa to enjoy life implicitly. (b. Risa is also <strong>reassuring and find a sense of security</strong> as her right as an Unwind is finally be respected.</p>
<p>\3.   How does Connor react to Lev’s arrival? Why does he react this way?</p>
<p>\1. Simultaneously Connor gets exhilarated and runs towards Lev. And then become rational, calmer for his betrayal and surprised for Lev is still alive. He doesn’t come to Lev immediately because he wants to see how is he going on currently. After their eyes meet Connor gets close to Lev, however punching him in his eyes and then pulls Lev into his hug with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>\2. Connor is always burning hatred towards Lev for his betrayal which is Connor’s last memory involved Lev so it must be remembered clearly. So, when other mixed flood of feelings passes away, this conspicuous emotion would definitely show up. However, having gotten in touch with Unwinds of diverse stories, Connor becomes more open-minded and remains kind and emotional always, therefore he still holds an instinct of caring about Lev. After all, Connor once saved Lev. He definitely doesn’t want someone saved by him to gain death again. Connor is someone that can never act against his heart, for instance standing on the side of Roland. Deep down Connor knows that Lev gets good qualities which match his conscience.</p>
<p>\4.   Who are <em>the Goldens</em>? What has happened to them? What is their connection between Connor and the Admiral?</p>
<p>\1. The <em>Goldens</em> are made up of Amp, Jeeves, another two boys and a girl. They are the Admiral’s five most trusted kids and therefore in charge. They are the ears and eyes of the Admiral to keep him abreast of the state of things among the Unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.  They suffocated in the same crate as those five kids who died in the same way during transmit.</p>
<p>\3. For the Admiral, the Goldens’ death works as a great loss but also a tool. Now the Admiral chooses Connor who is completely righteous to be his new eyes and ears, which would help him find out the real culprits. For Connor, the horrible incident gradually forms and strengthens his trust towards the Admiral. Also, Connor has now clearly clarified which side he is on.</p>
<p>\5.   What is the group’s philosophy for doing what they mysteriously do? Do you think this is a good reason? What do we find out they did in part 5?</p>
<p>\1. The group of three believe in randomness and forces of nature. Their belief is to create chaos and mess with the world.</p>
<p>\2. I don’t think it is a good reason…as making chaos makes no sense to me. But I do think there’s something behind an excuse of just wanting to mess up everything. The group extremely hate those people getting benefit from the Unwinds, so the hatred may be transformed into the intension to make all people suffer.</p>
<p>\3. They mess with the Admiral secretly. They kill the Goldens by creating a same death place and method for them as the five kids suffocated in the crate.</p>
<p>\6.   How is Risa and Connor’s relationship developed further in this chapter?</p>
<p>\1. Risa figures out that there’s something wrong with Connor. She is not so cold and rational as before, trying to keep distance between herself and Connor. Now, she becomes the one taking the first step to care about another. And Connor is also concerned about Risa’s safety. Their relationship greatly and amazingly develops in their reciprocal care.</p>
<p>\7.   What do we find out about the Admiral in chapter 37?</p>
<p>\1. The Admiral’s last name is surprisingly “Dunfee”, which makes me shudder and recall the former description of Humphrey Dumfee. Moreover, he is trying to redeeming himself and Emby is exactly a vital portion for making up the mistake of unwinding his son.</p>
<p>\8.   What interaction happens between Connor and Roland beginning in chapter 40? What is the result of this interaction by the end of part 5?</p>
<p>\1. Connor entices Roland into the FedEx jet, and then pushes him into Crate 2933 in violence in order to make it possible and safe for a conversation about the death of the Goldens.</p>
<p>\2. The interaction intensifies Roland’s hatred and fury against Connor, so he turns Risa and Connor in. However, the Juvey-cops also finds Roland guilty for association and all of them are taken to the harvest camp to get unwound.</p>
<p>\9.   What gives the mob its power? Why are the chapters leading up to the climax so short? Why does the author alternate between the mob and the other characters?</p>
<p>\1. The mobs’ ignorance gives them power. They trust rumors easily. Every horrible story comes true in their mouth so their fury can never be controlled.</p>
<p>\2. I think the short transition demonstrates how powerful rumors and the crowd are. It may only take the furious and blind people a few seconds to get to the climax of hurting someone physically beyond control. Meanwhile, it is also a great way to show how resentful the mobs are.</p>
<p>\3. I think the alternation between the mobs and other characters are quite profound, because “the other characters” here refers to Connor, Risa, Hayden, Roland, and the Admiral. Clearly, they are the main characters that the author is dedicated to talk about. The alternation actually forms a contraction which implies that these main characters are unique and influence the going of plot a lot. We can generally describe that the mobs are all doing the same thing—physical attack. But what these main characters are doing must be totally different, outstanding, and profound.</p>
<p>\10. Why is Connor’s quote ‘you should all be unwound’ so shocking? (pg. 193) Do you agree with him?</p>
<p>\1. Because Connor is always a righteous and kind figure for all of the Unwinds. The other Unwinds trust him and rely on him, so they believe that they have the same level of hatred to the Unwind order. Moreover, right there is the graveyard where they get protection from the Unwind order. Connor’s shocking words are definitely opposite from the graveyard’s purpose. More importantly, every Unwind feels grieved and uncertain about the fact that they are defined worthless. Connor’s words prove the credibility of their concerns to some extent so they are totally shocked.</p>
<p>\2. I partially agree with him. Of course, Connor doesn’t mean that but he is numbed with fury. Imagine, you see a bunch of people trying torturing someone you respect and appreciate, how would you react? And there is also something true about Connors’ words. It is the Admiral that covers the mobs from getting unwound. Without him, all of them would get that they supposed to suffer from. So, it is rational that the mobs would be unwound if they get rid of the Admiral. </p>
<p>\11. Why is Roland’s plan of turning in the whole camp of Unwinds quite futile? Why can’t Roland see that?</p>
<p>\1. The succeed of Roland’s plan based on whether the information he offered can surprise the cops so that Risa and Connor can be caught successfully as a reward to himself. However, the cops already know the existence of the graveyard and what the Admiral is doing against the law. They are just too lazy and irresponsible to round them up. In this way, the cops are not eager at all to capture all the Unwinds in Graveyard.</p>
<p>\2. Roland can only see his intension to make others suffer. He becomes blind owing to hatred and the desire for power, which blocks his observation, consideration and carefulness.</p>

        <p><strong>Part FOUR:</strong></p>
<p>u Why do you think Lev tells the pawnshop owner that he is an unwind and that the bracelet is stolen? Why tell the truth?</p>
<p>\1.  Because the pawnshop owner said that he will never deal with minors so if Lev cannot show a special identity, his hope for getting 500 dollars would be ruined.</p>
<p>\2.  Pastor Dan and his family were brainwashing him with the faith of God. And something good about this is that Lev is righteous and will not tell a lie.</p>
<p>\3.  Also, Lev is not afraid of demonstrating the identity of unwind, because he uses the high price of bracelet to threaten the greedy pawnshop owner.</p>
<p>u How does Connor escape being put in the crate with Roland?</p>
<p>\1.  First of all, Connor tries his best to hide his panic to stay calm. If he behaves weak and soft, Connor would definitely be “controlled” by Roland completely. Without the courage of changing situation right away, Connor would be teased by Roland and suffer from much more Roland’s violence.</p>
<p>\2.  Next, he creates a chaos wisely. Connor punches one of Roland’s henchmen, which nearly breaks that boy’s nose. Spontaneously, the Fatigues pulls Connor out of crowd to give him a warning and avoid another fighting. In this way, Connor is arranged into another crate naturally. </p>
<p>u Some very intense conversations take place inside the crate. For the first time we are able to see how the Unwinds truly feel without all the bravado that normally comes with them. Why are these conversations important for the reader to see?</p>
<p>\1.  Sometimes we only know about “how cruel unwinding teenagers is” “the teenagers don’t want to get unwound”, but it’s difficult for us to think deeper into this dystopian world because we are out of the book. But the unwinds, and their conversations are empathetic and sincere. From their conversations, we can be more empathetic towards the theme of this book and know this world better because the teenagers’ words are always true and transparent.</p>
<p>\2.  The unwinds are talking about individual reasons for unwinding. That completely reflects the dark side of human nature.</p>
<p>\3.  The context can also get people think more towards some philosophical topics like soul, and law.</p>
<p>\4.  The context shows a group of kids struggle to live and think under the gloomy unwind order. I think the author doesn’t choose a side. He just wants to show the most real world: everyone is thinking and thinking, trying to figure out the truth, then moving on and try their best to lead a nice life with diverse opinions towards the world.</p>
<p>u What is your first impression upon meeting the Admiral? Why? Explain. </p>
<p>\1.  I think the Admiral the amiable and enthusiastic—he welcomes the kids to come to graveyard as soon as they meet each other in the airport.</p>
<p>\2.  The admiral is quite professional according to his appearance—full of scars and doesn’t appear to sweat even in hot uniform.</p>
<p>\3.  The Admiral is someone who gets accumulated stories and experiences. Risa mentioned that his uniform is from the war between pro-life and pro-choice forces. But now, he chooses to protect the unwinds, who are derived from the war he attended in. That would be quite interesting to notice.</p>
<p>\4.  He is also quite responsible since he says “No one gets unwound on my watch.” and sets up an independent civilization system.</p>
<p>u What do you think the point of Cy mentioning the poster he saw about a salmon?</p>
<p>I think it is a foreshadow which anticipates the coming event. As aforementioned, Lev compares Cy to a salmon swimming upstream to get to the destination. So, the poster may be implying the coming trouble Cy is going to face—facing the cops.</p>
<p>u How do you feel reading chapter 30? Explain. </p>
<p>\1.  I actually feel gloomy after reading chapter 30. Clearly, when someone gets unwound, his or her brain keeps the previous memories and remains unchanged. In the context, Tyler carries his miserable pleading until being unwound. And for Tyler’s parents, it must be quite astonished and guilty when facing their son plead again after their last look towards each other. It may feel like facing the ghost of someone you killed. </p>
<p>\2. it is also heart-rending because I can feel how miserable and hysterical Tyler was.</p>
<p>u Why do you think Lev gets so upset at Tyler’s parents?</p>
<p>\1.  Tyler’s parents are comforting each other instead of comforting or responding to lev, which makes Lev furious.</p>
<p>\2.  He cannot bear to see Cy so miserable and hysterical. </p>
<p>\3.  Deep down, Lev is furious of his own parents because they also ignore Lev’s opinions when he is struggling and may want to lead his own life. This emotion is stimulated by what happens on Cy and is the resentment is transferred to Tyler’s parents.</p>
<p>u Lev says that he’s been, “changed by this moment, transformed in some deep and frightening way.” Why do you think he says that?</p>
<p>Before Lev thought unwinding is honorable and looked down to those kids who are scared to get unwound. But now Lev eventually realizes how miserable and hysterical an unwind can be in his or her limited lifetime. He is also disappointed towards those exclusive and distant people who show no sympathy to unwinds. Lev now sees a more real and cruel world than before, and all the negative information is against his justice, which makes him suffer. His good imagination towards this world vanishes and hatred takes its place.</p>

<p>Dear family,</p>
<p>​    Umm…hi…</p>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is pointless right? As you always told me: “high God love you much more than we do.”</p>
<p>​    Don’t know where to start. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage was blocked by myself and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. MAYBE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR YOU GAVE ME A SPECIAL SHELTERED STRUCTURE TO GROW UP? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous but familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: “You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter?” I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: “how can you say that?” “The pig is nothing, but you are the treasure of holy God!” “Gosh how could you…” My fault, you have definitely been thinking in that way since I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind that living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn faith, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, YOU ARE LIKE THE DIMNESS OF FIRE! I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. </p>
<p>You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from the school, I realized how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however I am now, indeed, when separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I just want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with overheated soul and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because the care from you “saints” are just water vapor that forms DIMNESS, so heavy, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you kept me company but what you would never realize is that the more you accompany (actually brainwash) me, the more I get to suffer, and MY SOUL ON FIRE AND LIGHT is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different functions of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water!!! But what else can I blame on you…You were fiercely protecting me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either—after all I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living, rather than some ludicrous mission!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I had my entire body on your hand whereas would never be noticed and then gone by the wind…uh then became “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>​    Besides, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                          Your new-born son,</p>

        <p>​    My junior high classmates define me as a girl who is “boy-proof”. “I don’t want to be her desk-mate because she is so dour!” “I don’t know her…wait a minute, Uh I see… She is the one never talks.” “You know, my friend Modesty, she never talks to a boy!” </p>
<pre><code> I’m born introverted but don’t want to embarrass others. Therefore, I feel so ashamed to them that I force myself to speak out, to take the first step, to change. But nothing changes and I define myself a waste of space. I feel as if everyone are trying their best to attack the injury that I struggle to hide…and they succeed. 

 One day, I’m talking to a psychologist casually about the “defect” and family. Simultaneously she has tears falling down, and I’m totally confused. She takes my hand, whispering: “My girl, your ‘defect’ only derives from your father’s frequent absence…that’s why you don’t know how to get along with boys.” At that moment, I’m relieved, but then heartbroken. So, I haven’t done anything wrong but only my plush toys know how many hours I’ve been crying. I really want to hug my earlier self and tell her “It’s okay.” But I won’t be inclined to self-pity anymore, because what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger. No one can define you. No one can decide who you are. So be yourself rather than being humble towards worthless people, whose “malice” is only ashes for a strong girl.</code></pre>

<p>Dear family,</p>
<p>​    Umm…hi…</p>
<p>​    Do you miss me? I suppose you still remember me…But to be honest, the eighteenth birthday of a tithe is not so significant right? After all you always told me: high God love you much more than we do. </p>
<p>​    Don’t know where to start. Papa, mama, you are clever. You had informed me my “holy duty” when I was so young and naive that I spontaneously believed everything you told. Gradually I blocked my fabulous imagination towards jobs and marriage, and my mind had nothing but “God is mighty”. MAYBE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR YOU GAVE ME A SPECIAL SHELTERED STRUCTURE TO GROW UP? Don’t you think it sounds ridiculous and familiar, like what Snape asks Dumbledore in their last talking: You’ve been raising Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter? I know, I know, irritably you would blurt out: how can you say that? The pig is nothing, but you are nearest to holy God! Gosh how could you…My fault, you have definitely been thinking in that way since I was born, and…I also find this one tricky. A few days ago, I told another unwind living without purpose is dreadful and all that in my mind forcing me to turn him in is your voice— “why not “contribute a voice to the world instead of being so meaningless?” But what’s your “holy” comprehension for “meaningless”? Uh, God! Because of your damn faith, I hurt the boy, and myself! For thirteen years, YOU ARE ALWAYS THE DIMNESS OF FIRE! I’m arrogant, exclusive, acting like cold-blooded animals, all blame on you. You still find yourself righteous? Read on. After I escaped from cops I called, I realize how much I want to be alive! In the past I was not alone due to the “glorious solace”, however now I am, indeed, separating myself from the identity of tithe. It is a brand-new feeling which I did not have, or in other words, should not have when being with you, like a fresh spring washing a headful of rust away. And for the first time I’m scared, conspicuously. Ha, levi, finally regretful? You wish. I want to be alive— totally alive. Eventually I start learning how to be a living person. </p>
<p>Curiously, how can loneliness, an emotion as cold as me, transform me and warm up my heart? Tell you then. Everyone is born with a warm heart and gets company mostly. I’m envious about these companions in the likeness of forest fawns continuously transporting wood for the burning of soul, because care from you “saints” are just water vapor forming THE DIMNESS, so heavy actually, far beyond what I can burden. Indeed, you keep me company but what you will never realize is that the more you accompany me (actually brainwash me), the more I get to suffer, and MY SOUL ON FIRE is more and more invisible. Clearly, now you can see the different function of “wood” and “water vapor”.</p>
<p>​    I was stifling under water! But what else can I blames on you…You were fiercely protective towards me…maybe just as a tithe…I understand…I wouldn’t choose myself either…I cannot be more frustrated than now. Thirteen years of brainwashing…I will never forgive you…Have you ever respected my soul??? My soul comes to this world for living, rather than some ludicrous mission!</p>
<p>​    Nevertheless… am I correct…? Who is correct about this world? Pastor Dan? Me? You? Jesus…my brain is breaking into pieces… Maybe you are correct…maybe…If so, I become tiny water living in sponge while your “justice” is the hand squeezing me out… I have my entire body on your hand whereas will never be noticed and then go by the wind…uh then become “vapor” ha… a further step away from “myself”. Perhaps I’m just too selfish…or wouldn’t be so painful towards this…Is Pastor Dan doing the right thing—Let me run away? I don’t know but I do feel relieved…like being saved from death. So…let me be selfish…just for one time…okay? I haven’t found “myself” yet. I need more time definitely and I’m not in a hurry. But I do see the hazy figure of myself deep down. He wants to be alive, truly. Why so desirable? No idea. But please…this time let me follow my heart…and I won’t blame on you anymore…I need to figure out who I am. Others are just meaningless to me now. </p>
<p>Besides, I haven’t loved myself for thirteen years.</p>
