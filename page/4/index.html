        <p>“Maybe someone is suitable to stay in 2020.”</p>
<p>When I first saw this piece of comment, it seems the only layer of meaning is： I’d better stay in this year to burden pains over and over again to stay strong in order to meet cruel society in future. But today, which is also the last day of 2020 in lunar year, eventually I discover something else that it is implying. It is someone in my memory that should stay in 2020 indeed, rather than myself. However, I would not deny their existence, but generally “let it go”, which is in the likeness of dust covered by fallen leaves.</p>
<p>However, we are supposed to move on. Someone once said, “The flowing water is competing for lasting gush rather than speed”. Li Bai, the genius poet in Tang Destiny, exclaims: “Send word to songbirds: stop quarreling and fly towards sky, which is thousands of miles high. “ My dear, friends, experience the sensation of running forward wildly, cuz only in this way can we reach the peak of the mountain of life, having a great view of unknown panorama.</p>
<p>someone is suitable to stay in 2020.</p>
<p>Thank you for these living-beings’ company, but you will never be the one who makes me better.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                             write in the end of 2020 (lunar year)</p>

        <p>Yesterday I started reading the first tale from Shakspeare, namely the Tempest. To my surprise, the grammar and vocabulary are not so difficult to understand while I learned several useful phrases and expressions. I like the appearance description of Caliban: “far less human in form than an ape” and some long sentences like: “By his orders they raised a violent storm, in the midst of which, and struggling with the wild sea-waves that every moment threatened to swallow it up, he showed his daughter a fine large ship, which he told her was full of living beings like themselves.” Shakspeare intended to use a variety of complicated long sentences which are quite hard to understand, but it is also very interesting to analyze them and absorb the writing skills. The first two pages I read chiefly treat of the background information of the island and main characters.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I started reading the novel unwind. During my reading, I can exactly feel Connor’s feeling of helplessness, as if the freezing and rushing water were cascading past me. I just cannot believe how can parents decide to get their cherubs unwound. Their hearts are cold and hard, which results in children in a gloomy. The whole world becomes mental, creating a solemn and horrible atmosphere in the beginning of the story. Readers, like me, experiencing a feeling of  near-drowning  when going through the contexts.</p>

        <p>Many people clarify that team work makes success, but through yesterday’s satisfying studies, I deeply realize the strong power of repeated self-thinking. Before, I enjoy meditation which fosters philosophical thoughts being came up with. Recently I’m struggling with Microeconomics and just cannot understand those abstract concepts, such as marginal utility, consumer surplus and dead weight loss. Nevertheless, I was really surprised to find out that persevering in trying to understand finally could work. No matter how complicated the question is, as long as going over notes over and over again, it would be solved unconsciously. We do need others’ good ideas, but enough time should also be reserved to offer ourselves a chance to get over difficulty. In this way, we build up confidence, and more importantly, we develop the spirit of persistence.</p>

In the evening, when I’m selecting new year’s suits with my mother, towards whom the shopping assistant appreciated: “how tender your daughter is!” That really made me recalls last semester’s Winter Syrup, in which I expressed the intension to comfort and benefit everyone in the world. I thought my so-called gentleness is useless and always ignored until now I realize its significance: cheer others up. And most importantly, cheer myself up, gaining eternal joy. </p>
<p>Today’s motto: knowledge makes humble, ignorance makes proud. So please always take in others’ suggestions, demonstrating I’m thinking about life.</p>

        <p>Recently, I’m taking two AP courses, namely Microeconomics and Calculus and I’ve found these tasks hard to deal with due to my poor time management and new knowledge’s being difficult to take in. What I can do now to improve the situation is out there, clearly. Firstly, keeps using the To Do APP which preventing wasting time and helps self-realization. Also, just don’t give up! It’s never too late to correct the mistakes, so, utilizing the days around New Year’s Day to catch up with your mates with online recorded videos which is absolutely for Calculus and just review the points again and again for Microeconomics. I believe I own the ability to get 5 in the end. And even though I do not want to, ask teachers as frequent as you can. Please don’t be shy.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I choose this topic because when I was reading and analyzing <em>O! Me! O! Life!</em> I started thinking about my own verse of contribution and immediately my eager of being nice to others came into my mind because it is exactly my true deep feeling. I think the question raised by the topic is quite important to me since the question helps me put my own experiences and feelings into deeper consideration and comprehension. There are loads of revision of this piece of work because it is the first time I work on a slam poetry. To make it achieve the standard of slam poetry, I actually spent loads of time creating rhyme scheme, repetition and looking for slang. The whole poem demonstrates my own thoughts: winter syrup represents both the speaker’s feeling when getting along with others and the speaker herself while to some extent the contributions of the speaker (represents the real me) and winter syrup are same, so the speaker’s contribution to this world is actually herself (it is actually a equivalent substitution in Math). And for these few lines: </p>
<p>Winter syrup flows inside body:</p>
<p>carefully creeping on my tongue,</p>
<p>lightheartedly running in my stomach,</p>
<p>easefully disappearing in the end.</p>
<p>I just want to show that the speaker feels sweet like having the syrup before, while and after she shows kindness to others. The sweet feeling is divided into three stages in the order of time, e.g. “carefully creeping” and “tongue” means the state which is before the speaker shows kindness. Also, in the poem I show the speaker has a thinking period:</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tik tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup sounds familiar!</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tick tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup compares with moving pointer of clock.  </p>
<p>I do not want my readers think that the speaker is so smart that she could get any truth without struggling. “Tik tock” and “clock” here indicate the speaker is thinking and linking syrup to herself. And I add “winter” before “syrup” because in this way the warmth and happiness of syrup can be better emphasized:</p>
<p>True warmth comes in winter,</p>
<p>’tis the season</p>
<p>when I become meaningful. </p>

        <p><strong>Winter Syrup</strong></p>
<p>I ask myself,</p>
<p>in appreciation</p>
<p>of the world, what is your contribution?</p>
<p>Consideration? Consolidation? Consumption?</p>
<p>Conservation? Operation? Imagination?</p>
<p>Interaction? Instruction? Invention?</p>
<p>Or the love to the nation.</p>
<p>Yeah, all are my anticipations</p>
<p>but they are never put into action.</p>
<p>After cogitation,</p>
<p>I cannot help but think of the confection.</p>
<p>Pathetically just for consolation.</p>
<p>Oh, confection!</p>
<p>In my heart it is in the form of syrup penetration.</p>
<p>Everyday I praise all the surroundings,</p>
<p>like Olaf in winter</p>
<p>“I am Olaf and I love warm hug!”</p>
<p>But intensely I want to offer my own hug:</p>
<p>push the door open for myself</p>
<p>while waiting for others as well;</p>
<p>order the meal hearty for myself</p>
<p>while smiling at waitress as well.</p>
<p>Winter syrup flows inside body:</p>
<p>carefully creeping on my tongue,</p>
<p>lightheartedly running in my stomach,</p>
<p>easefully disappearing in the end.</p>
<p>So now I ask myself again,</p>
<p>What is your contribution?</p>
<p>Ah! Happiness! Kindness!</p>
<p>Yeah, I gonna yell out these words.</p>
<p>Curiously.</p>
<p>That is exactly the contribution of syrup.</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tik tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup sounds familiar!</p>
<p>Tik tock. Tick tock.</p>
<p>Dripping of syrup compares with moving pointer of clock. </p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I got the answer.</p>
<p>Syrup is the feeling,</p>
<p>the feeling then forms me.</p>
<p>Now I am the syrup,</p>
<p>thus myself is the contribution.</p>
<p>True warmth comes in winter,</p>
<p>’tis the season</p>
<p>when I become meaningful. </p>

        <p><strong>On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Franz Joseph’s nephew, and Countess Sophie were assassinated by a young Serb in Sarajevo. Balkans, the powder keg, is exploded.</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1908, Bosnia was taken over by the Austrians and three years later, a Serbian secret society namely <strong>Unity Or Death</strong> (which is also known as “Black Hand”) was eager to get all Slavs of the Balkans into one country so aiming to get control of the Serbs near Bosnia. Definitely there would be tensions between Austria and Serbia. However, the Austrians made an unwise decision—their newspaper alleged that Ferdinand was going on a visit to Bosnia to review troops. Ferdinand’s intension was to scare Serbia but his act also offered Black Hand a chance to kill him and threaten. Also, the day that Ferdinand and his love Sophie arrived in Sarajevo was exactly Serbia’s National Day…</em></p>
<p>Ferdinand and his wife arrived in Sarajevo at 9.30 in the morning and were driven to Town Hall via Appel Quey in a motorcade. Six “killers” had already got prepared when the motorcade turned onto Appel Quey. Nevertheless, among them, neither Mehmedbašić or Čubrilović reacted. The situation changed when the third operative, Čabrinović, a young Bosnian, threw a hand grenade. Unfortunately, the bomb only detonated the limousine’s collapsible roof. Failing the task, </p>
<p>Čabrinović also failed to suicide so was arrested. Then, the motorcade escaped the death from the next three assassins (Popovic, Princip and Grabez) again because Popovic was short-sighted and Grabez chickened out and the cars were moving too fast. The “dramatic journey” did not end yet. After the couple arrived at Town Hall, the tour was soon cancelled. Austrian Governor advised a new route and the motorcade decided to backtrack. But they forgot to tell chauffeur the change of plan and when they were driving along Franz Joseph Street the Chauffeur finally realized the mistake. He then stopped and turned around at Schiller’s Store. By coincidence, Princip, who failed mission before, grab the opportunity at once and fired two shots. Ferdinand and Sophie soon died at 11.30 a.m. </p>
<p>“The world is right to be alarmed,” said a woman in London Street. “The conflicts in Balkans are never solved so this incident is inevitable.”</p>
<p>We agreed that the tragedy happened in Sarajevo is like another eruption of volcano. And now, the clashes and hatred between Serbia and Austria is like the whirlpool. Triple Entente and Triple Alliance would soon be sucked into, sending shock waves through the world. Yes, a great war is coming and let’s get prepared. </p>

<p>Our project work is related to peer pressure and I’m searching for information on the internet to learn this phenomenon better. This valuable website shows a clear definition of peer pressure and provides for categorized suggestions in terms of different groups of people.</p>
<p>Peer pressure is a feeling that one must act same as people in one’s age and social group in order to be regarded and respected. It is natural and beneficial for children to interact with friends as they grow and mature and actually peers play a vital role in the social and emotional development of teenagers. Their influences which can be either positive or supportive begin at an early age and increase through the teenage years. For the good aspects, peers are helpful in fostering one’s new skills and interests in numerous social and daily activities and events. On contrary, with the same strong level of effect, peers can also egg their companions on delinquencies and even risky behaviors, e.g. skipping classes, theft, cheating, remaining addicted to drugs or alcohol, etc. Due to the results of peer pressure, the majority of teens with substance abuse would begin using drugs of alcohols. This terrifying pressure can appear among both real life and social media. However, minors are always in concern of being left out or made fun by peers so would go along with the group.</p>
<p>There are still some tips on dealing with peer pressure. For teenagers, they need to stay away from “dangerous” peers and learn to say “no”. Meanwhile it’s very good for them to get in touch with other peers who resist peer pressure and talk to a reliable adult. When it comes to the parents, they are responsible to communicate with teenagers honestly and teach them the ways to resist. The friends and teachers of teens can be a useful target to share concerns with. Also, parents ought to prepare the backups in case of unpredictable situations for them. Last but not least, if the grown-ups manage to convert their children into the assertive ones, less likely such pressure would be gained. </p>
<p>All the information above is vital to my research. First of all, a clear definition is demonstrated so that it’s easier to understand the problems we are facing and the factors behind. Moreover, the advice is adaptable for the consideration of all groups of people who are able to improve the situation. In this way, I can draw conclusions of the available methods to solve peer pressure where our main subject is exactly focusing. </p>
