        <p><strong>Assignment 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Science and Beauty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isaac Asimov</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Walt Whitman’s best-known poems is this one:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>When I heard the learn’d astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide and measure them, When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I imagine that many people reading those lines tell themselves, exultantly,**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_1">W用1]</a>** <strong>“How true! Science just sucks all the beauty out of everything, reducing it all to numbers and tables and measurements! Why bother learning all that junk when I can just go out and look at all the stars?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a very convenient point of view since it makes it not only unnecessary, but downright aesthetically wrong, to try to follow all that hard stuff in science.**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_2">W用2]</a>** <strong>Instead, you can just take a look at the night sky, get a quick beauty fix, and go off to a nightclub.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The trouble is that Whitman is talking through his hat, but the poor soul didn’t know any better .</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don’t deny that the night sky is beautiful, and I have in my time spread out on a hillside for hours looking at the stars and being awed by their beauty (and receiving bug-bites whose marks took weeks to go away).</strong></p>
<p><strong>But what I see - those quiet, twinkling points of light - is not all the beauty there is . Should I stare lovingly at a single leaf and willingly remain ignorant of the forest? Should I be satisfied to watch the sun glinting off a single pebble and scorn any knowledge of a beach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those bright spots in the sky that we call planets are worlds. There are worlds with thick atmospheres of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid; worlds of red-hot liquid with hurricanes that could gulp down the whole earth; dead worlds with quiet pock-marks of craters; worlds with volcanoes puffing plumes of dust into airlessness; worlds with pink and desolate deserts - each with a weird and unearthly beauty that boils down to a mere speck of light if we just gaze at the night sky.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those other bright spots, which are stars rather than planets, are actually suns. Some of them are of incomparable grandeur, each glowing with the light of a thousand suns like ours, some of them merely red-hot coals doling out their energy stingily. Some of them are compact bodies as massive as our sun, but with all that mass squeezed into a ball smaller than the earth. Some are more compact still, with the mass of the sun squeezed down into the volume of a small asteroid. And some are more compact still, with their mass shrinking down to a volume of zero, the site of which is marked by an intense gravitational field that swallows up everything and gives back nothing; with matter spiraling into that bottomless hole and giving out a wild death-scream of X-rays.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are stars that pulsate endlessly in a great cosmic breathing; and others that, having consumed their fuel, expand and redden until they swallow up their planets, if they have any (and someday, billions of years from now, our sun will expand and the earth will crisp and sere and vaporize into a gas of iron and rock with no sign of the life it once bore). And some stars explode in a vast cataclysm whose ferocious blast of cosmic rays, hurrying outward at nearly the speed of light reaching across thousands of light-years to touch the earth and supply some of the driving force of evolution through mutations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those paltry few stars we see as we look up in perfect silence (some 2,500, and no more, on even the darkest and clearest night) are joined by a vast horde we don’t see, up to as many as three hundred billion - 300,000,000,000 - to form an enormous pinwheel in space. This pinwheel, the Milky Way galaxy, stretches so widely that it takes light, moving at 186,282 miles each second, a hundred thousand years to cross it from end to end; and it rotates about its center in a vast and stately turn that takes two hundred million years to complete - and the sun and the earth and we ourselves all make that turn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beyond our Milky Way galaxy are others, a score or so of them bound to our own in a cluster of galaxies, most of them small, with no more than a few billion stars in each; but with one at least, the Andromeda galaxy, twice as large as our own.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beyond our own cluster, other galaxies and other clusters exist; some clusters make up of thousands of galaxies. They stretch outward and outward as far as our best telescopes can see, with no visible sign of an end - perhaps a hundred billion of them in all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And in more and more of those galaxies we are becoming aware of violence at the centers - of great explosions and out-pourings of radiation, marking the death of perhaps millions of stars. Even at the center of our own galaxy there is incredible violence masked from our own solar system far in the outskirts by enormous clouds of dust and gas that lie between us and the heaving center.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some galactic centers are so bright that they can be seen from distances of billions of light-years,**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_3">W用3]</a>** <strong>distances from which the galaxies themselves cannot be seen and only the bright star-like centers of ravening energy show up - as quasars. Some of these have been detected from more than ten billion light-years away.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All these galaxies are hurrying outward from each other in a vast universal expansion that began fifteen billion years ago, when all the matter in the universe was in a tiny sphere that exploded in the hugest conceivable shatter to form the galaxies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The universe may expand forever or the day may come when the expansion slows and turns back into a contraction to reform the tiny sphere and begin the game all over again so that the whole universe is exhaling and inhaling in breaths that are perhaps a trillion years long.**</strong>[<a href="#_msocom_4">W用4]</a>** </p>
<p><strong>And all of this vision - far beyond the scale of human imaginings - was made possible by the works of hundreds of “learn’d” astonomers. All of it; all of it was discovered after the death of Whitman in 1892, and most of it in the past twenty-five years, so that the poor poet never knew what a stultified and limited beauty he observed when he “look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nor can we know or imagine now the limitless beauty yet to be revealed in the future - by science.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>   <strong>What is Asimov’s thesis and how does he support it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uses facts to support; to refute against the other side represented by Whitman</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ｔｈｅ　ｔｈｅｓｉｓ　ｉｓ　ｔｈａｔ　ｔｈｅ　ｕｎｉｖｅｒｓｅ　ｉｓ　ｆａｒ　ｂｅｙｏｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｃａｌｅ　ｏｆ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｉｍａｇｉｎｉｎｇｓ，ｔｈｅ　ｂｅａｕｔｙ　ｏｆ　ｗｈｉｃｈ　ｃａｎｎｏｔ　ｂｅ　ｆｕｌｌｙ　ｏｂｓｅｒｖｅｄ　ｂｙ　ｏｕｒ　ｅｙｅｓ．</em></strong>　</p>
<p><strong><em>Ｈｅ　ｓｕｐｐｏｒｔ　ｉｔ　ｂｙ　ｓｈｏｗｉｎｇ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｃｉｅｎｔｉｆｉｃ　ｆａｃｔ　ｂｅｈｉｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　＂ｐｅｒｆｅｃｔ＂　ｂｅａｕｔｙ　ｗｅ　ｃａｎ　ｓｅｅ　ｉｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｇａｌａｘｙ，ｉｎｃｌｕｄｉｎｇ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｔａｒｓ，ｔｈｅ　ｐｌａｎｅｔ，ａｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　ｕｎｉｖｅｒｓａｌ　ｅｘｐａｎｓｉｏｎ　ｅｔｃ．</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>   <strong>Outline the facts that Asimov presents about the planet, stars, galaxy, and universe that support his thesis.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Planets are worlds. There are  various worlds with a weird and unearthly beauty that boils down to a mere speck of light if we just gaze at the night sky.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Stars which are bright spots are actually suns.They are compact bodies,which could expand and explode.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Galaxy stretches so widely that it takes every stuff a really long time to travel across or around. There is also a cluster of galaxies.\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>All the matter in the universe was in a tiny sphere that exploded in the hugest conceivable shatter to form the galaxies in a vast universal expansion\</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>   <strong>What is the purpose of Asimov’s rhetorical questions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I be satisfied to watch the sun glinting off a single pebble and scorn any knowledge of a beach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>To call on people to try their best to be aware of the fact and truth behind objects and phenomenons while they are appreciating the obvious beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4a. In point form, outline the development of Asimov’s argument.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1 - Walt Whitman Poem</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2 - points out many people would agree with Whitman</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 15-Explain the fact that some limited beauty was discovered by astronomers after the death of Walt.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Parapraph 16-Express the concern of the uncertainty of the limitless scientific beauty would be discovered more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4b. How does he build unity and coherence?</strong></p>
<p><strong>unity—- focusing on composition or part of one on single topic —- stay on the topic</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author concentrates on the scientific results after Walt was dead so that the paragraph is always around the topic,which is the discussion of Walt’ unawareness of the limited beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coherence —- smooth and logic connection of sentences —- transition</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author use ‘so that’ to tell us that because the facts came after Walt’s death,it was some kind of reasonable for him not to realize the limited scientific beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5a. Find examples of logos, pathos, and ethos in this essay and explain how Asimov uses each one as support for his thesis. For each example, why do you think he used the mode of persuasion where he did?[\</strong><a href="#_ftn1">1]**</a>**</p>
<p><strong>The author uses pathos in paragraph 2 to express someone’s enthusiasm towards the beauty can be observed. The use of pathos can show a common attitude towards the definition of the beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>the author uses logos in paragraph 3 to explain the reason why people prefer realistic beauty  to support thesis.The author uses it not only for the keen to tell us how general the point of view is, but also stating hard and boring aspects of science.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethos is also included in this paragraph to deny the credibility of appreciating the scientific ‘brauty’,which support thesis.This could better and strongly confirm our positive attitude to the realistic beauty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Logos in paragraph 13 has a function of emphasizing the reason why the galactic centre can be seen from long distances. The author can connect the fact and reason closely in this way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is another logos in paragraph 14.The author support thesis by offer a condition of slower expansion. Because the real phenomenon needs stating, logos is definitely a better choice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5b. In thinking about the decisions writers make, what might be some pros and cons of using more than one mode of persuasion in a piece of writing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros are clear for the various types of logical expressions make the story colouful and thoughtful.The author’s point of view is mentioned through different methods so that readers would be quite impressed with the ideas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cons also exist.For different people of unsimilar age , personality ,or the ability to understand an idea,some kind of persuation may be suitable while the inverse can be true as well.For instance,it is usually easy for us to learn something from the words which was ecpressed by someone ,combined with emotion.However understanding complex logical expression could be of large difficulty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Did you find Asimov’s essay persuasive? Why or why not?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I find it persuasive for the facts given and the way explaining.Loads of evidences are strong enough ,consisting of effective persuations which follow logic,confirming the contrary of the credibility,causing a spread of mood.</strong></p>

        <p>The leaders or directors of organizations are often older people. But some people say that young people can also be a leader. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>points:</p>
<p>\1.    The young people are much more ambitious and radical than the elderly so that they usually force innovative strategies to ensure the organization step further.</p>
<p>\2.    Generally, older people turn to be a better leader for their long-term experience, which helps stabilize the crumbling of organization.</p>
<p>Some people think that the age limit (16) for driving should be increased in order to make driving safer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\1.    When the age is way above 16, people tend to burden more social responsibilities, like raising money to feed themselves. Thereby they are more cautious and responsible when handling with daily stuff, just like driving cars.</p>
<p>Open eyes, do not just look around our society. (border eye-view)</p>
<p>They are not legally responsible to embrace the possible consequences of bad driving.</p>
<p>The use of mobile phone is as antisocial as smoking. Smoking is banned in certain places so mobile should be banned like smoking. To what extend do agree or disagree?</p>
<p>\2.    Mobile phone and smoking are both antisocial. From the subjective view, smoking hurt not only personal health but also others’ health, which is a social issue thus should be banned. In comparison the effect of the overuse of mobile phone only represents a freely choice, not belonging to a social duty.</p>
<p>\3.    To be objective, both ought to be banned for loads of noises and radiation coming from phones can also simultaneously do harm to people’s physical heath</p>
<p>spontaneously. Some places</p>
<p>Mobile phone has social effects! (calling someone—loads of noise)</p>
<p>Some people believe that advertisement discourages us from being different individuals by making us all want be or look the same, to what extent do you agree or disagree? Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Revise: partly agree</strong></p>
<p>People have different opinions towards everything so that the advertisement can hardly assimilate us.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisement seizes people’s curiosity so it’s easy to tempt them with crafty marketing methods.</strong></p>
<p>It is people themselves deciding whether to accept the concept of the advertisement and being individuals or not rather the advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people know the purpose of advertising is to sell more, so will not believe in it completely. (I’m not sure if this point and the using of “most” is ok.)</strong></p>
<p>THE QUESTION IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT THINKING.</p>
<p>In many countries, prison is the most common solution to the problem of crime. However, another effective way is to provide people with better education so that they cannot become criminals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree.</p>
<p>If good education is provided, everyone will be affected[<a href="#_msocom_1">AO1]</a> in an ethical aspect, being told the influence of crimes and how is a prosperous and peaceful society beneficial, in which way “criminals” total actions in daily life would be converted into good manners depended on the belief in justify.</p>
<p>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Good education can provide moral standards and the consequence of crime so that “criminals” can be converted into good citizens.</strong> </p>
<p>It is impossible for government to take each person into consideration for education [<a href="#_msocom_2">AO2]</a> because of loads of factors etc. the gap between the rich and the poor, which means that the education methods won’t work. —–SO, GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT IS HARD? </p>
<p>crime</p>
<p>In comparison, prison adopts people without considering their background.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In comparison, prison involves people in without considering their background information.</strong></p>
<p>Education provided people with more options</p>
<p>Education is less efficient than prison.</p>
<p>Nowadays a large amount of advertising aiming at children should be banned because of the negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Partly agree</p>
<p>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits so that they won’t put too much attention on how it influencing[<a href="#_msocom_3">AO3]</a> children.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A large amount of advertising utilize children’s curiosity as a stepping stone towards profits without concerning some of its unsuitable contents for a child.</strong></p>
<p>Watching advertisement is also a chance for children to know more about how the</p>
<p>marketing system works and get in touch with current technologies appeared in advertising.</p>
<p>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? It depends.</p>
<p>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is good for the mental health while the reverse is true [<a href="#_msocom_4">AO4]</a> for staying alone.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When people gather together, it is more likely to create a warm and relaxing atmosphere which is better for the mental health than staying alone.</strong></p>
<p>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted by various people and communication issues caused among them.SO???? CAN’T SEE IT’S GOOD.</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Living with oneself avoids being disrupted thus one can enjoy a life with higher quality.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SO, what is your point? No good nor bad?? Too vague.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pls keep polishing this topic.</strong></p>

        <p>Homework: pls finish the outline of the essay topic “legalize Marijuana or not?”</p>
<p>Hook: <strong>In 2017, more Americans were arrested for marijuana possession than for murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery combined. There’s one Marijuana arrest every minute.</strong></p>
<p>Transition: <strong>as we all know, behaviors like theft are illegal with lower rate of arrest. So would the legalization of Marijuana truly help improve its control?</strong></p>
<p>Thesis: <strong>the government should legalize Marijuana indeed</strong></p>
<p>Point 1: <strong>the ban of Marijuana intensifies the intensions related to racism.</strong></p>
<p>Point 2: <strong>legalizing Marijuana benefits the growth of economy</strong></p>
<p>Conclusion: <strong>the legalization of Marijuana stabilizes the society</strong></p>
<p>Expand: <strong>following the common sense of boycotting drugs resolutely cannot always be the justice. Sometimes human beings’ mindset need switching.</strong> <strong>It is impossible for us to measure whether the prohibition is more predominant which can also cause social unrest.</strong></p>

<p>greatest weakness: lack of maternal love, do not know how to love</p>
<p><strong>Origin story:</strong> When/how/why did your character become a superhero? How did they get their powers? </p>
<p>Dorje lives in Shambhala which is mystical kingdom in Tibetan Buddhist tradition. He was born with the power of controlling the gold when chanting Buddhist scriptures. He also has an unknown power of concealing the two kingdoms as a gift of being the connection between El Dorado and Shambhala. Dorje was fed up with the perfect life in Shambhala, and when El Dorado was invaded by several human countries in the eager of gold, he decided to complete the mysterious mission, thus commanding the Shambhala army and returning all the stolen gold back to Eldorado. Finally, Dorje, as a superhero, concealing the two kingdoms in the aim of protecting ancient culture from human greed and maintaining peace in human world.</p>
<p><strong>Superhero Basics:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Why this name?</p>
<p>In Tibetan, “Dorje” means “diamond” which represents someone intrepid and tenacious.</p>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> What can your character do?</p>
<p>Dorje can control the gold when chanting Buddhist scriptures. He also has an unknown authority of concealing El Dorado and Shambhala due to his special identity. </p>
<p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Even Superman was allergic to kryptonite. Give your superhero a flaw. NOTE: “No Flaw” is not acceptable, flaws are interesting! </p>
<p>Exclusive, distant due to the loss of mother. Also, all the Buddhists living in Shambhala screen out extraneous thoughts like greed.</p>
<p><strong>Costume:</strong> Why this costume? What does the costume do? </p>
<p>Simple white dress as a Buddhist with a big pocket carrying the copy of Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>Prop:</strong> Is it a car? A ring? A staff?</p>
<p>Dorje has a special copy of Buddhist scriptures which is necessary when utilizing his power. For the power of controlling gold, he needs to chanting the context in the copy and when it comes to the concealing one, Dorje just need to split the copy.</p>
<p><strong>Personal feelings:</strong> How does your character feel about his/her powers? Like? Dislike? Lucky? Cursed? </p>
<p>Dorje was exhausted towards his super power at first due to the sufficient gold in Shambhala and there is no need to hide the two kingdoms as people can hardly find them.  But later he finds it necessary to use it to protect his people and culture so Dorje enjoys it and feels lucky.</p>

        <p>Allocate resource—answer economic questions (for whom, what, how to produce)</p>
<p>Ø Questions answered by Government: planned economy (intervention at maximum level)</p>
<p>Ø Questions answered by market: market economy</p>
<p>​              Price mechanism (invisible): reassure allocation</p>
<p>How price mechanism work:</p>
<p>1   Signal function: price is a signal to both consumer and producer.</p>
<p>2   Incentive function:</p>
<p>Ø Consumer: price get higher—they consume less</p>
<p>Ø Producer: price get high while the others remain the same, e.g. the cost is unchanged—higher profit possibility—so they would produce more.</p>
<p>\3.  rationing ration: price can ration the product—bidding—the one paying the highest price can choose first (especially during the period of shortage)</p>
<p>Visualize price mechanism: introduce demand and supply</p>
<p>Demand: willingness and ability for a consumer to purchase a particular product.</p>
<p>Ø Willingness: maximum utility—satisfaction</p>
<p>Ø Ability: restricted by income</p>
<p>Demand only represents how many unit of good the consumer want to purchase rather than actual consume.</p>
<p>Why demand is downward sloping:</p>
<p>Base on price change</p>
<p>1   Income effect:</p>
<p>Price change—purchasing power (real income) change—quantity demand change</p>
<p>i.e. price increases—real income lower—quantity demand lower</p>
<p>2  substitute effect:</p>
<p>   Price change—influence willingness to purchase substitute—quantity demand change.</p>
<p>​    i.e. price increases—more willing to buy its substitute—quantity demand lower</p>
<p>when analyze from quantity change: base on diminishing marginal utility</p>
<p>when consumer decide to purchase one more unit of next product, marginal utility (next unit of product with additional satisfaction) decreases so consumer is willing to pay less on next unit of product.</p>
<p>Distinguish between changes in quantity demand and demand:</p>
<p>\1.  Changes in Quantity demand: happens only when price changes</p>
<p>​     Other explanation: a. extend/contract of demand</p>
<p>​                b. move along demand</p>
<p>​      point movement—along the line—passive</p>
<p>\2.  Changes in demand: active (willing to buy or pay more)</p>
<p>Shifters of demand: SPICE</p>
<p>S: substitute</p>
<p>P: population and preference</p>
<p>I: income</p>
<p>C: complement</p>
<p>E: price expectation</p>
<p>Supply: willingness and ability for producer to produce.</p>
<p>Why upward sloping:</p>
<p>\1.  Incentive function (price increases—cost unchanged—more willing to produce)</p>
<p>\2.  Diminishing marginal productivity (more output—more input—optimum remain—productivity is lower)—marginal cost is rising</p>
<p>Distinguish between changes in quantity supply and supply</p>
<p>Changes Quantity supply: only happen when price change</p>
<p>Changes in supply: producer’s willingness and ability to alter price and output</p>
<p>Shifters of supply: COTTEN</p>
<p>C: cost of production</p>
<p>O: opportunity cost</p>
<p>T: tax</p>
<p>T: technology</p>
<p>E: expectation<br> N: numbers of producers</p>
<p>Only when price is not same as equilibrium price, disequilibrium achieved.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, three witches foretell that Macbeth will become the future lord and king. Many argues it is the prophecy or his character decides the fortune. I prefer the latter. Macbeth’s own behaviors are consistent with the prediction. To some extent the prophecy may somehow work as a psychological hint, but it actually expose Macbeth’s dark side and that’s why the prophecy seems mysterious. It is ourselves that truly manipulate our behaviors, rather than “true” prophecies.</p>

        <p>Today’s reading experience is really adventurous. The triplicate is standing on the cliff of being caught to harvest camp. They are forced to get on a school bus and reach a campus while avoid their identity being discovered. Meanwhile the phenomenon of stocking was mentioned again during their adventure which together with “unwind” become a serious problem to think of by the three kids. Also, the contradiction inside appears apparently. Lev is always trying to get away from the two “kidnappers” and unexpectedly expose Risa and Connor’s “crimes” to the school. But Lev is not a loyal tithe and is in torment and irresolution. He is also scared of seeing another brand new part of himself. There’s also a very meaningful sentence, which I have seen a month ago and I believe I now have some new perspectives toward it.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.”</p>
<p>That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory nature. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, because if his assassination succeeds, he may become a brave hero. Also, before becoming a real assassin, Macbeth suffers the torment of conscience. Everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it’s not our fault, but the struggling of human nature. That’s why the “perfect world” is not a perfect world. Only the neutralization of bad and good can makes us valuable and lively. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the test sent by God would eventually begin on each person. So they are less likely to find the real self and see the world with misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>In today’s reading, “triplicate” has gone into exile. I believe love has silently come to Risa and Connor and Lev won’t block their plan currently. Risa gets some clothes and food from suburbia brilliantly meanwhile a 19-year-old woman has just abandoned her newborn in the same place. I suppose a collision of destiny will soon happen on them coincidently. Also, something curious come out: the newspaper only reports the pileup incident on interstate rather than the escape of three AWOLS. In the last paragraph of reading, maybe another turning point emerges, which may lead to the arrest of “triplicate”. Here are some sentences which I think are full of philosophy.</p>
<ol>
<li>“So, what’s it like, knowing all your life you are going to be sacrificed?”</li>
</ol>
<p>​       “It is better than going through life without knowing you purpose.”</p>
<p>​       Connor: Maybe he’s finally starting to see the sense of staying alive.</p>
<p>It’s true that we should lead a life with explicit purpose. But I do not think not owning a purpose towards life means your life meaningless. There’s always a purpose that we have toward life, however unrealized by us, which is being alive. What Lev says means if we don’t have a purpose, than we ought to give up our essential purpose. Apparently, this is a logic fallacy of contradiction. Moreover, living-beings are born with the desire of discovering beauty, which could also be everyone’s purpose that makes our life meaningful. Generally, nothing is better than sacrificing our own life unless being active or voluntary.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Woman: How wonderful it is that she can dismiss her responsibility so easily.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, the woman think it is an excellent way to get rid of the newborn without being guilty. However, I convince there will be retribution for her, from the society. Even though the woman escape from her personal suffer in the future, this kind of demeanor would definitely induce tensions in the society.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>“You can’t change laws without first changing human nature.”</p>
<p>“You can’t change human nature without first changing the law.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically Laws are made by human, so only when human nature change can the laws themselves be changed. However, meanwhile all the laws, including some local traditions would generally influence someone’s thoughts and identity. Thus the combination of the two sentences is a paradox. They can both be true and rational, but I support the first one to a great extent. The change of human nature partially depends on the laws indeed, but the intelligent people are always thinking, and unwinds are revolting. When the tensions in society are outraged greatly, the law can also be changed. And for the first one, it is not completely correct of course. Such laws can be changed, but we don’t know it is the law makers’ nature that is changing or the citizens’.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I watched a film called <em>Alita: Battle Angle</em>. It’s the film adaptation of a Japanese manga and the most surprising message about this science fiction is the use of CG on Alita’s appearance. </p>
<p>The story happens in the 26th century in terms of a heart-stopping adventure of the mechanical girl Alita. The plot is evicted as following:</p>
<p>“In 2563, 300 years after Earth was devastated by a catastrophic war known as “The Fall”, scientist Dr. Dyson Ido discovers a disembodied female <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a> with an intact human brain while scavenging for parts in the massive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapyard">scrapyard</a> of Iron City. Ido attaches a new cyborg body to the brain and names her “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alita_(Battle_Angel_Alita)">Alita</a>“ after his deceased daughter. Alita awakens <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia">with no memory of her past</a> and quickly befriends Hugo, a young man who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem. She also meets Dr. Chiren, Ido’s estranged ex-wife. Hugo later introduces Alita to Motorball, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royal">racing sport</a> played by cyborg gladiators. Secretly, Hugo robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector, owner of the Motorball tournament and the ‘de facto’ ruler of the Factory, Iron City’s governing authority.</p>
<p>One night, Alita follows Ido; they are ambushed by a gang of cyborg <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer">serial killers</a> led by Grewishka. Ido is injured, and Alita instinctively fights using “Panzer-Kunst”, a lost combat art for machine bodies. She kills two of the cyborgs and damages Grewishka, who retreats. Ido reveals that he is a Hunter-Warrior, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter">bounty hunter</a> hired by the Factory. Grewishka goes to Dr. Chiren, who is working for Vector, for help. Despite Alita believing that fighting will help her rediscover her past, Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. Alita finds a highly advanced cyborg body in a crashed spaceship outside the city. Recognizing that the body belonged to a Berserker —deadly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_troops">shock troops</a> of the enemy nation United Republics of Mars (URM) from the Fall, of which Alita was a member— Ido refuses to install Alita in it.</p>
<p>Frustrated, Alita registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo are unable to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to help her take down Grewishka. Zapan, a cyborg Hunter-Warrior <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully">bully</a>, provokes Alita, and she severely beats him in a fight, triggering a chaotic bar brawl until Ido arrives to intervene. Suddenly, an upgraded Grewishka appears and challenges Alita to a duel, revealing that he has been sent by Zalem’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocrat">technocrat</a> overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Despite her combat skills, Alita’s body is damaged by Grewishka, before Ido, Hugo and Hunter-Warrior dogmaster McTeague arrive and force Grewishka to retreat. Ido apologizes and transplants Alita into the Berserker body.</p>
<p>Having fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout race for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem. Hugo’s relationship with Alita leads him to decide to quit his criminal job. He confronts his partner Tanji, but Zapan appears, kills Tanji and frames Hugo for the murder of another cyborg. Hugo narrowly escapes and calls Alita for help; she abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan does. Zapan mortally wounds Hugo. Dr. Chiren, having changed her mind about working for Vector, offers to help save Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita’s life support system. When Zapan sees through the trick and attempts to stop Alita, she seizes his prized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel">Damascus</a> blade and injures him.</p>
<p>Ido transplants Hugo’s head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector’s offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie; as an exiled citizen of Zalem, Ido is certain that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem without becoming a motorball champion. Alita storms the Factory and confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs. Vector summons Grewishka, but Alita’s new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotech">nanotech</a> body allows her to easily destroy him. She forces Nova to speak to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally stabs Vector.</p>
<p>Ido tells Alita that Hugo has fled to climb a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He eventually agrees, but a serrated defense ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Alita catches him but cannot pull him up. Hugo thanks Alita for saving him before falling to his death.</p>
<p>Months later, Alita is a rising superstar in the Motorball tournament. Cheered on by the crowd, she pledges vengeance by pointing her plasma-charged sword toward Zalem, where Nova watches from above, smirking.” (from Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The film teaches me to be tenacious, persistent and intrepid. Although Alita is dismembered into several parts, she still tries to utilize all the rest strength to fight. After Alita is rearranged again by his “father”, she finds her confidence again and destroys other bounty hunters completely. As a cyborg, Alita miraculously own the pure love with Hugo and continues her great goal after Hugo is dead. As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Alita has been beaten hard for several times, but the courage to move on and fight will absolutely make her a winner in the following series.</p>

        <p>Today I come to notice two more new main characters, namely Risa and Lev. Compared with Connor, Risa is not a naughty and worrisome kid, but a good however not excellent girl. Risa’s school cannot bear such normal kids so sent her to a unwind case. Risa’s world is stifling. You be the best, or nothing. It forces every kids to study desperately and the miserable fate would come if mistakes are made. </p>
<p>Lev is completely different from both Risa and Connor, since he is willing to be unwound as a tithe. When he is rescued by them, he pretends to work together with them while preparing to get three of them unwound in the future. </p>
<p>Written and placed individually in terms of main characters own perspectives, the context and plot is closely connected while showing every unwinds’ perspectives towards what’s going on.</p>
