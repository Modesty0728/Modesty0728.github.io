        <p>Darwin started studying artificial selection as early as 19th century, choosing pigeons as the experiment objects whose traits would be selected by someone feeding them. Obviously, human beings have been exploring artificial selection field over centuries and their curiosity continues. After adapting the environment, normally people would select the advantageous living beings in order to lead a more satisfying life. The genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, are one of the profound products or examples of artificial selection whose “genetic materials are artificially manipulated”. In other words, GMOs are created against nature. Our research based on GMO would focus on the first consumption-allowed bioengineered animal ever—GM salmon (also known as AquAdvantage salmon).</p>
<p>The size of GM salmon is much larger than its non-transgenic siblings, and the time it takes to grow to market size is half time as conventional Atlantic salmon. Also, they can grow to market size in about 16 to 18 months. The transgenic salmon shows a doubled size comparatively in a certain growing period. </p>
<p>Before artificial selection, salmon’s growth cycle is 32 to 36 months. They’re slow growers, and in the first year of life they may achieve a weight of between 20 to 30 grams.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few countries in the world use this method to improve the quality of salmon, e.g. US, Canada, and Argentina. The first transgenic salmon was created in 1989, in Canada. People used artificial selection to salmon that grow all year around, instead of only growing in spring and summer. On 19 November 2015, after confirming its safety for food for five years and environmental safety for three years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AquaBounty’s genetically modified salmon for marketing. People are gradually accepting genetically modified salmon.</p>
<p>So, what are some details about this “delicious” technology? AquAdvantage salmon is originally Atlantic salmon with another special gene from the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The scientists then transfer the growth hormone (or growth promoting gene) from it into fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs, which allows the original (Atlantic) salmon reaches the market weight in a short time and grows in a less hospital environment. The ultimate AquAdvantage salmons are all sterile females, which directly fights back the concerns of them breeding with wild salmon. Wenonah Hauter, the chairman of Food and Water Watch, also came up with the disapprovals about salmon’s wild competition ability. Once again, this one is backfired by Dr. Eric Hallerman who claims that the final product is domesticated. Preliminary results also say that AquAdvantage salmon are less competitive than their “ancestors”—the Atlantic salmon in the plight of limited feed. However, although it is possible and finally becomes true that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the final product, about 60 retailers (combined with 4,660 stores) deny the hope of having GM salmon sold in their stores. Ironically, the researches up to now not only prove GM salmon unthreatening, but even confirm their benefits to the environment. As aforementioned, there are concerns based on the survival of wild animals. However, AquAdvantage salmon actually can conserve wild fish populations. Their growing process towards market size requires 25% less feed than Atlantic salmon, which makes aquaculture much more sustainable. Also, AquaBounty farms GM salmon in land-based facilities that means short distance to the grocery store, which cuts down on transportation, and therefore 23 to 25 times fewer carbon emissions also compared with the Atlantic ones. The company also has full control over their aquaculture rearing ecosystem, i.e. water input and discharge, sanitation and the ability to recycle resources.</p>
<p>GMOs have always been a controversial topic. In science class, we talked about their pros and cons. One of the biggest concerns is about GMO’s uncertainty in the future. Through this meaningful research, we see how amazingly a new product comes out. We also see scientists initiate arguments and then prove the facts through effective analysis and researches. We can only say that up to now the AquAdvantage salmon are safe and friendly to both people and the earth. No matter what could happen on this brand-new species, we should always appreciate the great efforts put in this field which promotes the development of GMO.</p>

        <p>So glad but melancholy to finish our <em>Unwind</em> as the end of term 3… I have learnt so much since the winter holiday, and just watch how many blogs are related to this one…</p>
<p>Before I thought my perspectives are untouchable authorities. Now it is so funny but touching to look back and see how many times my opinions has been beat and then reformed. Mrs. Smith suggested us to be open-minded on the first class starting <em>Unwind</em>. And now I’m proud to tell that I did it. What remains to do is firstly edit my compare and contrast essay, sending it to Mrs. Smith, and most importantly, revise the Unwind Project to make my dream come true. It is the first time that I start to analysis an English novel so deeply and has been provoked so many thoughts towards human nature. But I also suggest myself to improve my reading method due to all the awful quizzes marks. Next time just try not to be so “deeply”… you are just trying to hard…</p>
<p>As a remembrance and enthusiasm, I have started the second book of Unwind series– UnWholly and really found something that made me link back to Unwind. Good luck for the furthermore exploration of Unwind series!</p>

        <p>The universe is infinite and no one is sure about its capacity, but that allows human beings’ wild imagination and exploration. They discover the technology of unwinding and grafting, however their stupidity also grows wildly along with the crazy exploration. Stupidity now does not imply that unwinding is totally absurd. It is suggesting we have been only focusing on what’s the next research to do rather than stopping for a while and reflect on ourselves. Pathetically is we ignore this suggestion, our stupidity turns infinite. I believe the author is just reflecting on what happens in the book. People make a compromise between pro-life and pro-choice, but they never stop to think further…</p>

        <p><strong>Graveyard: unusable planes are stored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another figurative meaning by using this as the final destinations of the Unwinds.</strong></p>
<p>I do think it is a profound choice to make Graveyard the final destination.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s irony here. The introduction of Part5 says, “Graveyard is not a land where abandoned planes piled up”. Unwinds here actually have something to do and the abandoned planes here are in symbolism of them. It emphasizes that the Unwinds’ final destination won’t be nothing but waiting for death. They are going to prove themselves meaningful.</p>
<p>Moreover, “keep active aircraft flying” refers to using effective parts to fix an aircraft. I think it is implying the intension of the Admiral to save the Unwinds from being into pieces and ensure their safety. </p>

        <p>I wouldn’t purchase a “human soul” even though it really exists. First of all, I have no intension to buy a soul which is useless to me. Moreover, people can never purchase a priceless product, just like a soul. If everyone tries to buy a soul, this pure, intangible substance will become cheap and vulnerable. The soul offers someone life and thoughts. If it is shared by others, no one’s life is completed then.</p>

        <p>I think this piece of part3 introduction is quite interesting and thought-provoking. It is related to BBC so what happens makes me empathetic and uncomfortable because it seems related to our real life. </p>
<p>And the author included this is not only because of it reflects the main topic of unwinding and dystopia. In the end of report, something familiar is mentioned: “It could possibly be a result of harvesting stem cells from bone marrow.” I can recall the depictions towards Cy-Fi ‘s experience of receiving lobe, which causes trouble of being controlled later on. So perhaps this piece of report suggests us considering the importance of brain and whether it is a wise choice to provide every organ to recipients. I think he is trying to tell us: unwinding is causing trouble.</p>

        <p><strong>What do the quotes by the two nurses teach you about human nature?</strong></p>
<p>It tells me that the human nature is highly related to the law. The change of law regulates and sometimes limits our behaviors and that’s why most people’s human nature is gradually changing over a long period due to fully obeying the law. However, this kind of change in human nature would definitely change the law again since people and the law both demonstrates same purpose.   Thus, the human nature that changes the law is clearly against it and is much stronger than the previous one because it is influential enough to change human nature and therefore the law.</p>

<p>“this isn’t a perfect world” mean s we cannot consider something something completely right or wrong and everything is too complex to give a simple and hasty definition. But “people who think it is” are exactly the ones who are narrow-minded or not critically thinking.

        <p><strong>What was something  that surprised you while looking at the world laws of abortion map, why? explain. Why is it important that we respect each other’s perspectives or values even if it does not match our own?</strong></p>
<p>For the first question, what has surprised me while looking at the map is the big total number of all the countries  which allow abortion totally. And also in the introduction of the purpose of the map, it indicates the desire to “advance abortion rights as human rights for women and girls around the globe”, which  also demonstrates it is on the pro-choice side. In my opinion, children are not pets of mothers and they do not have to accept anything that their mothers ask them to do. In other words, children are born their own rights to live that no one, including their mothers is reasonable to ignore their rights so the statistics and explanation really surprise me. And for the second question, it is important that we respect others just because everyone is equal. We all respect our own perspectives and values and so do others. That’s why we need to be respectful to protect everyone that is as equal as you are.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I finished my mid-term drama duet performance–pretty girl/plain girl. It’s quite touching and dramatic to recall my previous fear towards drama in the beginning of the term. I really need to be confident–always feel frustrated and anxious during rehearsal… oh I wouldn’t get out of my comfort zone! oh I’m acting so bad! oh tomorrow I would fail everyone! But I’m proved to be excellent! To my great surprise, nearly every peer was so amazed and shocked by my acting that they said ‘’You are already a superstar in Hollywood!” “You’ve completed a miracle!” Therefore I believe I really have done a great job. It is so amazing that I can exactly do those silly stuff that I dare not to imagine before. But what this experience impresses most is that it prove my hard work meaningful. All the frustration was not because of my really bad work, but the intention to behave perfect. Thanks to drama, I’ve been out of my comfort zone for so many times only in this term! I can conspicuously feel my great progress and developed confidence. Can you imagine that? I was even nervous during verbal presentation and felt so embarrassed when doing movements in front of the class. I think my present results greatly prove my great efforts–99% in GPA, 28/30 for pantomiming… Now I really feel confident in drama. It is not over confidence. It is my efforts that build up my confidence.</p>
