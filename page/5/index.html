        <p>Today I come to notice two more new main characters, namely Risa and Lev. Compared with Connor, Risa is not a naughty and worrisome kid, but a good however not excellent girl. Risa’s school cannot bear such normal kids so sent her to a unwind case. Risa’s world is stifling. You be the best, or nothing. It forces every kids to study desperately and the miserable fate would come if mistakes are made. </p>
<p>Lev is completely different from both Risa and Connor, since he is willing to be unwound as a tithe. When he is rescued by them, he pretends to work together with them while preparing to get three of them unwound in the future. </p>
<p>Written and placed individually in terms of main characters own perspectives, the context and plot is closely connected while showing every unwinds’ perspectives towards what’s going on.</p>

        <p>Last time I mentioned of the relative successful escape of Connor. To my great surprise, Connor is now caught by cops and in front of him is exactly his own father, which indicating the unfortunate destiny is coming again. How can this happen? The incident is attributed to Connor’s carelessness. He has forgotten to turn off his cell phone to cut down signals in case of being tracked. That remind me of the importance of thinking thoroughly to protect myself. Connor’s dangerous current situation concerns me a lot. What he gonna do? Connor makes a split-second decision of running again in front of his father and cops, which is absolutely a very intrepid act. You know, some people can be born with a unfortunate fate. Sometimes they have the chance to convert it into miracle, however only by great courage and tenacious spirit.</p>

        <p>Today I watched a film called <em>Hi, mom</em> with my family,  a great screen work  in terms of  appreciation of mother’s love which makes us wildly laugh with tears stand on the rim of eye. I think the morals are really meaningful which can be inferred from several scenes.</p>
<p>One of the classical scene is about the volleyball battle between Li Huanying and Wang Qin. There are tensions between the two girls so they are both eager to defeat each other. And the furious players are outraged even more when it comes to match point. However, I was so much impressed when Huanying said, “Don’t be serious with the match. Just consider it as a game!” I appreciate Huanying’s tolerance and calming mentality. She is brave enough to put winning and losing aside. Due to her outstanding magnanimity, Wang Qin has already been beaten completely.</p>
<p>When Shen Zhilin is performing comet in front of the audience, he and Jia Xiaoling are very amazed at the calming audience since their friend Zhang Jiang can’t stop laughing during the rehearsal. This particular scene remind me of the different opinions among generals and comet effects on stage and from rehearsal. So when we want to create a particular atmosphere for a show, reactions from different groups of people should be collected in order to avoid embarrassing occasions in a performance.</p>
<p>The subsequent reality caters to my satisfaction. Wang Qin, snobby and arrogant towards Li Huanying, flaunts her son’s relative success to Huanying pridefully. That is exactly why Jia Xiaoling does her best to help Huanying lead a better life instead of abasing herself. Nevertheless, it is very dramatic to notice that Jia Xiaoling becomes a well-known celebrity in the future. Huanying says, “I only want a healthy and happy kid, rather than a renowned superstar.” Even if Xiaoling is not so successful, she and Huanying are absolutely more cheerful and light-hearted than Wang’s family. There’s no need to compare ourselves with each other. Live happily, life meaningful!</p>
<p>The most moving scene in the movie is the young Li Huanying with the real mind of the dying old Huanying answers Jia when Jia murmurs “mom”, which is also the impressive climate of the whole movie. Usually, time-travel series’s most regrettable thing is the impossibility of other characters to realize the time-traveler’s real identity. But in <em>Hi, mom</em>, the climax surprises all of us which turn the impossibility into something possible, breaking the barrier of time.</p>
<p>I think Huanying would never regret to have Xiaoling as her daughter no matter what kind of fate she will face, because she asks for nothing.</p>

        <p>Recently I found a fabulous album released by Dabin in 2019, containing 10 electroacoustic works. Last summer I discovered the single called <em>Bloom</em>. The fresh music style of chorus immediately attracts me which sounds like bells’ slight collision along with the reverberation of flowing freezing water. Later I found myself prefer the lyrics than the beautiful tune:</p>
<p>“Where we are stay this way</p>
<p>wrapped up in a summer daze</p>
<p>try to find that piece of time</p>
<p>that let’s me freeze you in my mind</p>
<p>I don’t want us to change don’t want us to chip away</p>
<p>oh I am trying to save our bodies against the waves</p>
<p>could we stay in bloo-oo-oom</p>
<p>everything is new ooh ooh</p>
<p>I don’t want to leave this room just let me stay</p>
<p>let me stay with you</p>
<p>could we stay in bloo-oo-oom</p>
<p>could we stay in </p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>could we stay in</p>
<p>holding tight to what we had</p>
<p>if it’s lost will it come back</p>
<p>tell me if this windin’road</p>
<p>is made of dirt or made of gold</p>
<p>…………”</p>
<p>It was exactly the gratuate season when I was listening to this song. And I thought the bloom was refering to our fine youth, which together with my friendship I afraid to chip away. I’m also crazy over the unique style of the album’s cover, drawn by Erica William. It demonstrates a group of teenagers are ready to conceur danger without any fear in a painting style much similar to Miyazaki Hayao, which fully applies colors to a drawing of Utopia.</p>

        <p>“Maybe someone is suitable to stay in 2020.”</p>
<p>When I first saw this piece of comment, it seems the only layer of meaning is： I’d better stay in this year to burden pains over and over again to stay strong in order to meet cruel society in future. But today, which is also the last day of 2020 in lunar year, eventually I discover something else that it is implying. It is someone in my memory that should stay in 2020 indeed, rather than myself. However, I would not deny their existence, but generally “let it go”, which is in the likeness of dust covered by fallen leaves.</p>
<p>However, we are supposed to move on. Someone once said, “The flowing water is competing for lasting gush rather than speed”. Li Bai, the genius poet in Tang Destiny, exclaims: “Send word to songbirds: stop quarreling and fly towards sky, which is thousands of miles high. “ My dear, friends, experience the sensation of running forward wildly, cuz only in this way can we reach the peak of the mountain of life, having a great view of unknown panorama.</p>
<p>someone is suitable to stay in 2020.</p>
<p>Thank you for these living-beings’ company, but you will never be the one who makes me better.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                             write in the end of 2020 (lunar year)</p>

        <p>Yesterday I started reading the first tale from Shakspeare, namely the Tempest. To my surprise, the grammar and vocabulary are not so difficult to understand while I learned several useful phrases and expressions. I like the appearance description of Caliban: “far less human in form than an ape” and some long sentences like: “By his orders they raised a violent storm, in the midst of which, and struggling with the wild sea-waves that every moment threatened to swallow it up, he showed his daughter a fine large ship, which he told her was full of living beings like themselves.” Shakspeare intended to use a variety of complicated long sentences which are quite hard to understand, but it is also very interesting to analyze them and absorb the writing skills. The first two pages I read chiefly treat of the background information of the island and main characters.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I started reading the novel unwind. During my reading, I can exactly feel Connor’s feeling of helplessness, as if the freezing and rushing water were cascading past me. I just cannot believe how can parents decide to get their cherubs unwound. Their hearts are cold and hard, which results in children in a gloomy. The whole world becomes mental, creating a solemn and horrible atmosphere in the beginning of the story. Readers, like me, experiencing a feeling of  near-drowning  when going through the contexts.</p>

        <p>Many people clarify that team work makes success, but through yesterday’s satisfying studies, I deeply realize the strong power of repeated self-thinking. Before, I enjoy meditation which fosters philosophical thoughts being came up with. Recently I’m struggling with Microeconomics and just cannot understand those abstract concepts, such as marginal utility, consumer surplus and dead weight loss. Nevertheless, I was really surprised to find out that persevering in trying to understand finally could work. No matter how complicated the question is, as long as going over notes over and over again, it would be solved unconsciously. We do need others’ good ideas, but enough time should also be reserved to offer ourselves a chance to get over difficulty. In this way, we build up confidence, and more importantly, we develop the spirit of persistence.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I read about a piece of motto: truly outstanding charm comes from our hearts, which is our gentleness. In the evening, when I’m selecting new year’s suits with my mother, towards whom the shopping assistant appreciated: “how tender your daughter is!” That really made me recalls last semester’s Winter Syrup, in which I expressed the intension to comfort and benefit everyone in the world. I thought my so-called gentleness is useless and always ignored until now I realize its significance: cheer others up. And most importantly, cheer myself up, gaining eternal joy. </p>
<p>Today’s motto: knowledge makes humble, ignorance makes proud. So please always take in others’ suggestions, demonstrating I’m thinking about life.</p>
