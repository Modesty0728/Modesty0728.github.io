        <p>I think this piece of part3 introduction is quite interesting and thought-provoking. It is related to BBC so what happens makes me empathetic and uncomfortable because it seems related to our real life. </p>
<p>And the author included this is not only because of it reflects the main topic of unwinding and dystopia. In the end of report, something familiar is mentioned: “It could possibly be a result of harvesting stem cells from bone marrow.” I can recall the depictions towards Cy-Fi ‘s experience of receiving lobe, which causes trouble of being controlled later on. So perhaps this piece of report suggests us considering the importance of brain and whether it is a wise choice to provide every organ to recipients. I think he is trying to tell us: unwinding is causing trouble.</p>

        <p><strong>What do the quotes by the two nurses teach you about human nature?</strong></p>
<p>It tells me that the human nature is highly related to the law. The change of law regulates and sometimes limits our behaviors and that’s why most people’s human nature is gradually changing over a long period due to fully obeying the law. However, this kind of change in human nature would definitely change the law again since people and the law both demonstrates same purpose.   Thus, the human nature that changes the law is clearly against it and is much stronger than the previous one because it is influential enough to change human nature and therefore the law.</p>

<p>“this isn’t a perfect world” mean s we cannot consider something something completely right or wrong and everything is too complex to give a simple and hasty definition. But “people who think it is” are exactly the ones who are narrow-minded or not critically thinking. Actually there’s no definite difference between black and white because they can be exchanged, which is the secret of the world. People who cannot realize it are someone unclear about this world, living without a clear mind.</p>

        <p><strong>What was something  that surprised you while looking at the world laws of abortion map, why? explain. Why is it important that we respect each other’s perspectives or values even if it does not match our own?</strong></p>
<p>For the first question, what has surprised me while looking at the map is the big total number of all the countries  which allow abortion totally. And also in the introduction of the purpose of the map, it indicates the desire to “advance abortion rights as human rights for women and girls around the globe”, which  also demonstrates it is on the pro-choice side. In my opinion, children are not pets of mothers and they do not have to accept anything that their mothers ask them to do. In other words, children are born their own rights to live that no one, including their mothers is reasonable to ignore their rights so the statistics and explanation really surprise me. And for the second question, it is important that we respect others just because everyone is equal. We all respect our own perspectives and values and so do others. That’s why we need to be respectful to protect everyone that is as equal as you are.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I finished my mid-term drama duet performance–pretty girl/plain girl. It’s quite touching and dramatic to recall my previous fear towards drama in the beginning of the term. I really need to be confident–always feel frustrated and anxious during rehearsal… oh I wouldn’t get out of my comfort zone! oh I’m acting so bad! oh tomorrow I would fail everyone! But I’m proved to be excellent! To my great surprise, nearly every peer was so amazed and shocked by my acting that they said ‘’You are already a superstar in Hollywood!” “You’ve completed a miracle!” Therefore I believe I really have done a great job. It is so amazing that I can exactly do those silly stuff that I dare not to imagine before. But what this experience impresses most is that it prove my hard work meaningful. All the frustration was not because of my really bad work, but the intention to behave perfect. Thanks to drama, I’ve been out of my comfort zone for so many times only in this term! I can conspicuously feel my great progress and developed confidence. Can you imagine that? I was even nervous during verbal presentation and felt so embarrassed when doing movements in front of the class. I think my present results greatly prove my great efforts–99% in GPA, 28/30 for pantomiming… Now I really feel confident in drama. It is not over confidence. It is my efforts that build up my confidence.</p>

<p>​                                                                                                           March 28th, 2021</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Surprise! Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! I’m Modesty Zhou from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China who is remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite book! It is so exhilarating to show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I am when reading Roland’s unwinding part— the most shocking episode of this book for sure!! “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman I see myself: lay in the bed, overwhelmed with the flood of grievances and passion. No one came to comfort me. I was on fire… my limbs would soon burn out! It felt like squeezing a sponge… Fury fled out so I continue squeezing even though the sponge has been compressed into the size of nail. At that time fire spread out wildly, from skin to heart… from mind to nowhere… rage began to retaliate— ha, you, no place to burden me right? Then I would invade your soul… we will see the depth of your soul… Fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should have been turned into ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Generally, I <strong>understand</strong> every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I can almost see a little soft baby in cradle with heart on <strong>fire</strong>… can you imagine that— the purest creature in the world versus “natural demon”— lullaby versus disaster… How could I ever abhor Roland anymore after “experiencing” his real life? Oh Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> <strong>feeling</strong> I had. Now a tragic Unwind “visualizes” my hidden pain…and everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the despair in Roland’s heart… We are not the same, but here is the magic of reading: maybe you only see a piece of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that person…and you are exactly <strong>that person</strong>! The sense of empathy is now intensified which is the distillation of the overlapped life traces.</p>
<p>​    By the way your language can be so entertaining sometimes that brings fresh fragrance to adjust the stifling atmosphere, just as lively kids. I love this one so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and even smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed (honestly most parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy…), half fruity. </p>
<p>Speaking of the language and content, I must emphasize my enthusiasm towards Part 2 which impresses me so much that it tastes like Christmas frosting which gives the favors an intensely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time! That is owing to the insightful “philosophies” in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what Part 2 attracts me most is how deeply it leads me to “dive” into the reflection towards <strong>human nature</strong>. Your novel shows me a brand-new world, profound but yet amazing, and more surprisingly connects with my other studies— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc. <em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory characteristics. We cannot fully value Macbeth as evil, since he may really become a brave hero if his assassination succeeds. But before assassinations, Macbeth has already suffered the torment of conscience… Perhaps everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it is just implying the struggle of human nature rather than our fault. It is not the neutralization of bad and good that makes us extraordinary— it is the courage to <strong>choose</strong> to leave the dark side. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the choosing test would be eventually sent to everyone. They are less likely to find their real selves undoubtedly…Oh and this one confuses me for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.</em> I once felt Nurse Greta was indifferent and marble-hearted to say such words. Nevertheless, Connor ironically receives an arm from Rolland in the end. I began to consider whether unwinding is <strong>that</strong> wrong… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds… That feeling is as complex as our attitude towards the water— it may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> provides readers with a free secret garden to “think, think, think” about ourselves, and about the world. People have intense discussions for “soul” and “human nature” topics. The questions you raised up permit myself to also contribute a “thoughtful” voice which may even help in some ethical fields— who knows whether designer babies would cause troubles in the future…</p>
<p>I do think <em>Unwind</em> demonstrates the reality of the changing human nature. Lev’s transformation is conspicuous. When I first went through Connor’s story in the very beginning of the novel, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I register Connor’s slight changes imply that he is not brave or impulsive all the way. He had been intimidated by the prospect. And actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. Some Unwinds’ tough exteriors hide a sensitive and vulnerable soul… Courage makes us strong, but its developing process starting from fragility makes us outstanding. Wow, sounds so familiar… you know it is so amazing to gain the same perspective from different contents! </p>
<p>After reading, I’m also eager to ask some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave <em>Unwind</em> an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Dramatically… I’ve been affirming that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side because most parts focus on how the Unwinds fight against the Order. However, as aforementioned, now I realize that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you (sorry for offending) write more supporting lines for the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Maybe your neutral stance is clear in the aforementioned “perfect world theory”? That would make more sense… but still why did you create such a dystopian world if pro-choice side is also quite reasonable? Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always intends to “set Lev free”? It’s quite puzzling to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believe Pastor Dan is waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But at the end of the novel he says he still keeps his faith… so if he never believes in “a god who condones human tithing”, why did he brainwash Lev with tithing ideas? Meanwhile if he believes in that god, why did he entice Lev to run away? The figure of God in Pastor Dan’s mind may be changing all the time…?</p>
<p>“Lilies smell worse than weeds when they rot.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said when they bloom.”</p>
<p>You can never imagine how much I start to think about the human nature… let’s hope that what happens in <em>Unwind</em> would never come true in the reality. Thank you so much for offering me the novel as a key to the exploration of human nature.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Surprise! Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! My name is Modesty Zhou from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China. I’m remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite scientific novel I ever read! It is so exhilarating for me to get a chance and show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I was when reading Roland’s unwinding part— the most shocking episode of this book for sure!! “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman I see myself: lie in the bed with flood of grievances and passion, rushing my whole body which is overwhelmed and then on fire. No one comes to comfort me. I thought my limbs would soon burn out. It feels like squeezing a sponge. Fury flees out so I continue exerting force even though the sponge has been compressed into the size of nail. At that time fire spreads out wildly, from skin to heart… from mind to nowhere… rage begins to retaliate— ha, you, no place to burden it right? Then I would invade your soul… we will see the depth of your soul… Fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should have been turned into ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Generally, I <strong>understand</strong> every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I can almost see a little soft baby in cradle with heart on fire… can you imagine that— the purest creature in the world with the “natural demon” addicted to killing— lullaby versus disaster… How could I ever abhor Roland anymore after “experiencing” his real life? Oh Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> feeling I had. Now a tragic Unwind visualizes my locked pain…and everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the despair in Roland’s heart. We are not the same, but here is the magic of reading: maybe you only see a piece of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that person…and oh you are exactly <strong>that person</strong>! The sense of empathy is now intensified which is the distillation of the overlapped life trace.</p>
<p>​    By the way your language can sometimes be so entertaining that brings little fresh fragrance to adjust the stifling atmosphere, just as lively kids. I love this one so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and even smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed (honestly most parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy…), half fruity. </p>
<p>Speaking of the language and content, I must emphasize my enthusiasm towards Part 2 which impresses me so much that it tastes like Christmas frosting given the favors an intensely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time. That is owing to the insightful “philosophies” in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what <em>Unwind</em> attracts me most is how deeply it leads me diving into the reflection towards human nature. Your novel shows me a brand-new world, profound but yet amazing, and more surprisingly connects with my other studies— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc. <em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory characteristics. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, since he may really become a brave hero if his assassination succeeds. Before assassinations, Macbeth has already suffered the torment of conscience… Perhaps everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it is just implying the struggle of human nature rather than our fault. It is not the neutralization of bad and good that makes us extraordinary— it is the courage to leave the dark side. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the choosing test would be eventually sent to everyone. They are less likely to find their real selves undoubtedly. In addition, this one confuses me for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.</em> I once felt Nurse Greta is indifferent and marble-hearted to say such words. Nevertheless, Connor ironically received the arm from Rolland in the end. I begin to consider whether unwinding is <strong>that</strong> wrong… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds… The complex feeling is like our attitude towards the water— it may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> provides readers with a free secret garden to “think, think, think” about ourselves, and about the world. People have intense discussions for “soul” and “human nature” topics. The questions you raised up permit myself to also contribute a “thoughtful” voice which may even help in some ethical fields— who knows whether designer babies would cause troubles in the future…</p>
<p>I do think <em>Unwind</em> demonstrates the reality of human nature. Lev’s transformation is conspicuous. When I first gone through Connor’s story in the very beginning of the novel, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I register Connor’s slight changes implying that he is not brave or impulsive all the way. He had been intimidated by the prospect. And actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. It tells me that some Unwinds’ tough exteriors hide a sensitive and vulnerable soul. Courage makes us strong, but its developing process starting from fragility makes us outstanding. Wow, sounds so familiar… you know it is so amazing to gain the same perspective from different contents!</p>
<p>After reading, I’m also eager to ask for the answers to some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave <em>Unwind</em> an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Dramatically… I’ve been affirming that you are definitely standing by the pro-life side as most cases focus on how the Unwinds fight against the Order. However, as aforementioned, now I realize that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you write more supporting lines for the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Maybe your neutral stance is clear in the aforementioned “perfect world theory”? That would make more sense… but still why did you create such a dystopian world if pro-choice side is also quite reasonable? Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always intends to “set Lev free”? It’s quite puzzling to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believe Pastor Dan is waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But at the end of the novel he said he still keeps his faith… so if he never believes in “a god who condones human tithing”, why did he brainwash Lev with tithing ideas? Meanwhile if he believes in that god, why did he entice Lev to run away? The figure of God in Pastor Dan’s mind may be changing all the time…?</p>
<p>“Lilies smell worse than weeds when they rot.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said when they bloom.”</p>
<p>You can never imagine how much I start to think about the human nature… let’s hope that what happens in <em>Unwind</em> would never come true in the reality. Thank you so much for offering me the novel as a key to the exploration of human nature.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Your faithful reader,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Shusterman,</p>
<p>​    Here comes a reaction to your dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>! My name is Modesty Zhou, coming from British Columbia Academy in Nanjing, China. I’m remarkably obsessed with this piece of work…to be honest <em>Unwind</em> has become my favorite scientific novel ever! It is so exhilarating for me to have a chance to show how much I love this one.</p>
<p>​    You cannot imagine how empathetic I was when reading the part of Roland getting unwound…which is the most tremendous episode of this book. “I’m alone. And I’m crying. And no one’s coming to the crib. And the nightlight burned out. And I’m mad. I’m so mad” Gush Mr. Shusterman when I was reading I saw myself! You know, lying in the bed with flood of grievances washing out reason, rushing my whole body almost burning on fire. No one comes to comfort me. I thought my body will soon burn out. It feels like squeezing a sponge. Fury flees out leading to continuously exert even though the sponge has been squeezed into the size of nail. At that time fire spreads out wildly, from skin to heart, then to nowhere… fury begins to retaliate— no place to burden right? Then I would invade into your soul… we will see the depth of your soul. Yeah…fortunately, my soul has huge “capacity”, or I should be turned in ashes like a flower in fire. That’s why I feel so related to Roland! Actually, I understand every character, but cannot <strong>feel</strong> every one of them, truly. I almost can see a little soft baby with heart on fire… can you imagine that… the purest creature in the world with the “nature demon” addicted to killing. How could I tease Roland before after “experiencing” his real life? Dear, Mrs. Shusterman, you let me see myself. I thought no one would ever comprehend <strong>that</strong> feeling. Now a tragic Unwind silently demonstrates my locked pain…everything he did all seems “rational” for me. I can exactly feel the sense of despair in Roland’s heart. Roland and me are not the same, but here the magic of reading comes…maybe you only see a sentence of depiction of the character then you feel like you know all of that man…and oh you are totally that man! Empathy is now intensified— overlap of life trace is the distillation of empathy.</p>
<p>​    Your language is entertaining, bring little fresh and fragrant air to adjust the stifling atmosphere, like lively kids. I love this part so much— “The woman wears a floral print blouse with lots of leaves and pink flowers. Risa would like to attack her with a weed whacker.” It makes the novel look and smell like fruit dropping into car in rainy days— half decayed, half fruity. To be honest, the beginning and parts of <em>Unwind</em> are really gloomy and stifling…</p>
<p>Part 2 impresses me so much which tastes like Christmas frosting given the favors a lovely creamy taste and texture, lasting for quite a long time. That is because of several insightful philosophies in this part. I got addicted into Harry Potter series due to the adventurous, original and fabulous plot. Comparatively, what <em>Unwind</em> attracts me most is how much it leads me deeply into the thinking towards human nature. I never have dug into such philosophical and insightful topic before. Your novel brings me into a brand- new world, profound and amazing, most surprisingly connected with my real life— designer babies in Science class, tales of Shakespeare…etc.<em>In a perfect world everything would be either black or white, right or wrong, and everyone would know the difference. But this isn’t a perfect world. The problem is people who think it is.</em> That reminds me of the tragedy happens on Macbeth. He says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen”, which fully indicates his contradictory nature. We cannot fully judge Macbeth as evil, because if his assassination succeeds, he may become a brave hero. Also, before becoming a real assassin, Macbeth suffers the torment of conscience. Everyone has a dark side, and someone’s is hidden while someone’s is not. Sometimes it’s not our fault, but the struggling of human nature. That’s why the “perfect world” is not a perfect world. Only the neutralization of bad and good can makes us valuable and lively. People who think the world is perfect are judging the world too simply, without realizing the test sent by God would eventually begin on each person. Therefore, they are less likely to find the real self and see the world with misunderstanding. This sentence makes me confused and even dissentient for a long time: <em>Love the ones you can. Pray for the rest.”</em> I once felt Nurse Greta is indifferent and marble-hearted. Nevertheless, in the end I found out that Connor ironically received the arm from the unwound Rolland. I begin to think that whether unwinding is completely wrong since I had been so stubborn before… after all the world needs a healthy and complete Connor to save other Unwinds. It’s time for head above stifling and dangerous water. It’s like our attitude towards water: may nearly suffocate us, however we cannot lead a life without it. That’s when I realized that the life is filled with pity and resignation. What we only need to do is to “love the ones we can”. The rest would be prayed and meritorious. You see? <em>Unwind</em> really offers an unrestrained secret garden to think, think, think about myself, about the world.</p>
<p>​    After reading, I’m also eager to ask for the answers to some questions. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.

However, as aforementioned, I now find out that unwinding is not always an awful decision…thus I wonder why didn’t you write more discourses to support the pro-choice side in order to show your neutral attitude. Also, in part four we come to the topic of the soul. I read a lot of dialogues about it and also think a lot. I’m sure that no one in this world can certainly deny or prove the existence of soul, which is why soul brings out so many discussions. Another big question is related to Pastor Dan. In the beginning I thought he is a “big boss”. I wonder if Pastor Dan always have the intension of “setting Lev free”? It’s quite contradictory to consider his identity and what he tries to do. I believed Pastor Dan was waiting for chances to let Lev run away and “pastor” is only mask for living and protection. But later he said he still keeps his faith…</p>
<p>​    I really enjoy <em>Unwind</em> because I think it recessively but amazingly shows the reality of human nature. For instance, the novel begins with the story of Connor. When I first read this part, I only focused on the plot. Oh, he got a relationship with Ariana. Oh, he was anxious about the Unwind Order. However, through thorough analysis, I found out his slight but vivid changes: Connor was intimidated by the prospect. Actually, it was Ariana who lit up Connor’s courage to kick AWOLs. It tells me that some Unwinds’ tough exterior hides a sensitive and vulnerable soul. Courage makes us strong, but its developing progress from fragility makes us outstanding.</p>
<p>​    Thank you so much for offering the world such a wonderful book. You can never believe how much I start to think about the world, about the human nature.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                         Your faithful reader,</p>

        <p>UTA HAGEN</p>
<p>Questions for Character Study</p>
<ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a teenage girl who is typically plain. When facing others’ teases, I stay humble and melancholy but still carefully tries to be myself— to do what other girls may do to make myself pretty.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>By the registration desk for the Galaxy Girl Pageant with chairs nearby, out of school.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>The registration desk, the registration paper, a pen, Tara, a bunch of chairs</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Afternoon/dawn.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register for the Galaxy Girl Pageant… I don’t know whether I’m overconfident or blind… (when I put on those heels at home, I felt <strong>a little bit exhilarated</strong>— I’m acting like a princess! It wouldn’t be too bad compared with other girls…) Although still timid and humble, I light up my courage, pretending to be perky, to say “yes” and register. However, Tara points out my white feather deep down and sharply. In great sadness, Tara keeps convincing me to drop out… but I believe I can stand any of the teases and insults. Maybe just <strong>I believe</strong>… I haven’t given up yet thanks to plenty of practices done which makes me feel invincible. So weird Tara is! Her confusing actions provoke my hidden sense of inferiority— yeah, the pretties are with the pretties and I’m do hurt by what Selene said. All the trials out of the comfort zone, like registering the pageant, is aiming to get myself out of the labels— “plain”, “boring”, “not worthy hanging out with”. I’m not giving up. I want to prove that people like Selene are wrong. But Tara’s passionate comfort pulls me out of the hidden fury and bigoted decisions. She makes her sacrifice outrightly, and eventually we come close to each other.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>Tara is my best friend and I found Selene distant who makes me feel humble and worthless.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register the Galaxy Girl Pageant to show that I’m also pretty compared with anyone else.</p>
<p>More importantly, deep down I want to rebuttal the people who define me as “boring” and “plain”.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>\1.   Tara teases me for my plain appearance</p>
<p>\2.   The sense of inferiority due to other people e.g. Selene’s judgement.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I light up my courage to get out of my comfort zone. Register the Pageant and practice wearing heels a lot… what I am doing is aiming to be myself rather than remaining intimidated by the insults.</p>

        <p>u How does the author keep you in suspense in the first page of this chapter?</p>
<p>Connor wakes up in a medically induced coma, unconscious for two weeks which seems like eternity. His body is wound with bandage and the ache from whole body still doesn’t go away. However, everyone should know that Connor is the key Unwind, he couldn’t be released. Therefore, the nurse who comes to look after him might still someone working for Happy Jack Harvest Camp… Connor and Risa may still under the control of harvest camp and can get unwound later. The whole explosive actions happened before would worth nothing…like a big joke.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is ironic that Connor received the particular transplant that he did?</p>
<p>It seems quite ironic because Connor is the one who said “I would rather die than receive a piece of Unwind” before and he tried to run away from the destiny of getting unwound desperately. But now, he received a eye and an arm during his unconsciousness— he got something he never wants…he got something that comes from the procedure he ever wants to escape from. It must be astonishing and scary for Connor to accept. Yeah, it may seem ironic to Connor himself, but it was not his <strong>choice.</strong> Actually, this scene changes my attitude towards unwinding quite a lot. You see, Connor is always the one I appreciate, consistently fighting against unwinding, fighting for human rights. But when he is in then danger of dying, our superhero also needs organisms to survive, to fight back again. I think that’s why New York Times gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Now I wouldn’t be so outright like before emphasizing that unwinding is totally an unethical thing to do. I would be more open-minded. Maybe there are no right or wrong for the compromise between pro-life side and pro-choice side. God throws this tuff question to the world, just in aims of awaking us from blindness and staying open-minded. Fight for what you love, and accept the rest. Just as Nurse Greta said, <strong>“Love the ones you can, pray for the rest.”</strong></p>
<p>u What does Risa think Connor has changed into (end of chapter)?</p>
<p>Risa thinks Connor has changed into a man from a boy. It isn’t Connor’s age makes him man— it is how much he has grown up. The sense of naïve and impulsive have faded away. Connor’s soul was tamed by his impulsiveness. However, after having gone through so many difficulties, his soul begins to tam any other threats.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev’s lawyer talk to him about ‘insanity like it’s a good thing’?</p>
<p>Because from the lawyer’s point of view, he or she needs to stand by the side of Lev and to protect his life from unwinding. Insanity for becoming a clapper actually saves Lev’s life due to the chemicals in his blood. Therefore, “insanity like it” is a good thing for Lev which get him out of unwinding destiny.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is fitting that Connor has taken over the Graveyard?</p>
<p>Connor is probably the most suitable leader of Graveyard.</p>
<p>\1.  He owns a good reputation and authority— from the “rumor” of Akron Unwind to what happens at Happy Jack Harvest Camp, the Unwinds respect and believe in him.</p>
<p>\2.  He owns excellent leadership. Connor unites all the Unwinds in Graveyard to contribute to what they are fighting for.</p>
<p>\3.  Connor can now handle this responsibility. The courage of risking for life remains while the impulsiveness for acting without thinking vanishes.</p>
<p>\4.  Connor’s previous experiences are closely related to this place. He knows it well.</p>
<p>u Is the final message of the novel a positive one? Why?</p>
<p>It is a positive one, at least for Connor. Someone he loves, good friends, and all the kids facing the Unwind Order are all with him. Connor knows that now he doesn’t need to fight alone anymore. More importantly, he can see hope despite the threat of being exposed, which offers courage for all the Unwinds to live on.  </p>
