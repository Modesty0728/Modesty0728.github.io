        <p>Today, my school life is filled and even more enjoyable than last week! During the first period, I participated in <em>unwind</em> ‘s part 2 discussions actively and happily got the answer to the confused question (Lev’s running away is due to confused emotion or the change of attitude towards getting unwound). For the last indoor PE class, I find myself have learnt so many about how to deal with mental issues and STIs. Chinese Chemistry really helps improve Science’s current learning and although I didn’t get perfect in the naming quiz, the small mistake reminds me of the insufficient learning towards Bohr Diagram and the whole particle unit. I’m not as miserable as I used to be, and I believe what I’ve actually covered would definitely help in the future tests. Science is easy and cheerful to learn as usual. I’m so glad to learn how to project rather than yelling in Drama class, and my little entertaining performance really surprised myself. So I’m more open that I supposed! I really enjoy drama and believe I can improve much more in the following few months.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I thought it is a bad thing that there are not pictures in the newspaper of the AWOLs because Risa and Connor are probably in the danger of being killed. However, based on my peers, I now realize that it can also be good since no report makes it easier for three of them to escape and hide. And the reason there are not reports can also be something outside the context which is referred from. Maybe the cops just don’t want to screw up their reputation and then cause consuming anxiety for citizens since they let three teenage unwinds escape in front of them.</p>
<p>And for the reason why Lev has such a mixed feeling on the bus to school is that He still wants Risa and Connor get unwound rather than being killed, which is kind of a ridiculous thought to us.</p>
<p>Connor’s attitude towards the storked baby is mentioned for many times, and Connor sees the irony and considers it ridiculous, so does not want it happens again. Although he is very kind to save the baby, it is still not a smart thing to do when facing the danger of getting unwound.</p>
<p>For Pastor Dan, we argued about whether he has betrayed or not. And eventually, the fact is, the concepts contradicting with each other in his heart is his responsibility as a Pastor and something really in his heart.</p>
<p>I asked about a question in class, which is the reason for Lev going away rather than going to the cops after the alarm is pulled. It is because he now does not want to get unwound anymore or he is confused and overwhelmed and just want to be alone and calm down? Mrs. Smith told us she would choose the latter. </p>
<p>There’s something I didn’t consider about the impact of the teacher. Mrs. Smith clarified that author’s intension is to reflect the real dystopia society: there are people just like the teacher who also think  “unwind” is wrong but they cannot do anything.</p>
<p>The antique shop where Risa and Connor goes to is actually a reference to the underground railway in the 19th century which is used to hide black people and transport them to the North.</p>
<p>When Sonia suggests Risa to get pregnant again, Risa is surprised while Connor feels awkward.</p>
<p>The big kid, Roland, he’s anger is probably comes from this stepfather’s violence towards his mother. He is hostile, which is similar to Connor to some extent and that’s why he supposes that Connor is threat to his leadership. Shark represents “strong”, “powerful”, so Roland wants to show dominant through the tattoo (may because of his stepfather’s dominant). And the amazing experiences of the three unwinds hidden underneath Sonia’s trapdoor can show how crazy this world or dystopia is.</p>

        <p><strong>Part TWO:</strong></p>
<p>u Why aren’t there pictures in the newspaper of the AWOLs? Is this a good or bad thing? (pages 43-44)</p>
<p> \1.  The signal of “no pictures” shows that the cops do not have the usual intension of tracking them and then taking them to get unwound anymore. This time the cops are definitely facing a special case in which they probably want to end up the three AWOLs’ life or kill the two kidnappers, following the order of Lev’s rich family.</p>
<p>\2.  This is definitely a bad thing because at least Risa and Connor now are facing a much scarier destiny of being killed rather than just getting unwound.</p>
<p>u What are Connor’s three emergency modes? Which one does he use on page 47?</p>
<p>\1.   What is different from Connor and others is that he always has one more emergency codes compared to the common ones namely “Fight” and “Flight”, which is “Screw Up Royally”. </p>
<p>\2.   What he uses on page 47 is the particular one: “Screw Up Royally”. In the context, it is explained as “a dangerous mental short circuit” and Connor’s previous short circuit of saving Lev is mentioned before introducing his current action towards the storked family. The author aims to clarify the same feeling of “the brain starts to fry” to show that Connor is using the same mode again.</p>
<p>u What happens to Lev on page 52? Why are his feelings so conflicted?</p>
<p>\1.   Lev moves one seat forwards to put more distance between he and the two “kidnappers”. He then reaches into the backpack of a boy absorbed into music sitting next to him, pulling out a notebook and pen, writing down the “distress signal” of being kidnapped. However, the boy is furious towards Lev’s using his stationary without asking therefore ignores what Lev is suggesting and rips out the page without looking at it.</p>
<p>\2.   lev thinks Risa and Connor still needs to follow the justice of being unwound to make themselves in different parts more meaningful. However, there is something in the darker recesses of his unconscious that is upsetting him. He don’t want them get killed and Lev knows the two “kidnappers” are not a danger to himself anymore.</p>
<p>u Why does Connor take the Storked baby? What does this tell us about his character?</p>
<p>\1.   Because he has seen a storked baby twice on his own doorstep, which is a same situation compared with what is currently happening. That may reminds Connor of the guilty feeling of remaining hands-off and stimulate his empathy.</p>
<p>\2.   This indicates that Connor is empathetic and soft deep down. He couldn’t bear the pain of watching new-borns dying and I admire his spirit of doing boldly what is righteous.</p>
<p>u Did Pastor Dan betray Levi? Why or why not? What situation is Lev in now? (pages 60-62)</p>
<p>\1.   It depends.</p>
<p>\2.   For Lev, Pastor Dan betrays him totally. In the past years, Pastor Dan acts just like his family, brainwashing Lev with the high idea of tithe. But now, just as Lev thinks, “led him to a cliff only to turn away at the last moment”, Pastor Dan forces Lev to convert his thoughts into brand new ones which is completely unknown to Lev. However, “betray” means to ignore your principles or beliefs in order to achieve sth or gain an advantage for yourself. Maybe Pastor Dan has never betrayed his faith. For Pastor Dan, everything all happens in a sudden that he may not have the chance to explain something that is hidden.</p>
<p>\3.   Lev is now dealing with a mixed feeling composed of happy, scared and confused. He has made the mistake which diminishes Connor and Risa’s trust towards him meanwhile deciding to face the unknown self and make up for what he has done.</p>
<p>u Why do you think the teacher helps the Unwinds, even though she knows helping them is a federal crime? (pages 63-64)</p>
<p>\1.   Because the teacher is experienced. She knows “how often compassion takes a back seat to expediency” and “kids only have this kind of desperation in their eyes when they’re going to be unwound. The teacher has seen so many miserable tragedies so she is quite empathetic. She once had the thought of these two “put myself and the school at risk”, but then understand what Connor is saying: “please be a human being”, because deep down the teacher approves that she ought to save living-beings from death.</p>
<p>u Where does the teacher take the Unwinds? What kind of place is it?</p>
<p>\1.   She leads the unwinds to the exist however Risa and Connor are recognized and followed by cops. They then create a great mess, pretending to be clappers and in the boiling crowd the teacher points the way to antique shop on Fleming Street and someone called Sonia.</p>
<p>\2.   The antique shop is in an older part of town and is quite old, with only one consumer and plenty of odd antiques.</p>
<p>u What does Sonia recommend Risa do to stay safe? How do Risa and Connor react? (page 74)</p>
<p>\1.   Sonia recommends Risa to have Connor get her pregnant “again” to stay safe because an expectant mother will not be unwound and Risa will then be bought nine whole months.</p>
<p>\2.   Both of them feel embarrassed and are silently against this idea. Risa is even annoyed by Sonia’s behaviors.</p>
<p>u What three other Unwinds do they meet? Why are they being unwound?</p>
<p>\1.   The three other unwinds are not moving and look exhausted and wary. </p>
<p>\2.   The smirker, Hayden comes from a ridiculously wealthy family however his parents got divorce and the brutal battle over him could not be resolved after two years. In the end his parents preferred getting Hayden unwound to allowing the other to have custody. </p>
<p>\3.   The Asian girl with pink hair is Mai. As the fourth girl in her family, she is nothing to them compared with the new-born son.</p>
<p>\4.   The big kid with a shark tattoo is Roland. He is being unwound because Roland beat up his stepfather for beating him mom who unexpectedly chose her husband’s side.</p>
<p>u Who is Roland? What tattoo does he have on his arm? What kind of person is he?</p>
<p>\1.   Roland is a muscular guy hidden behind Sonia’s trapdoor with other two unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.   He has a shark tattoo on his arm which looks scary.</p>
<p>\3.   Roland is ambitious, aggressive and suspicious. He has a dream of being a military boeuf and is strong enough to fight against his stepfather. He is probably the least friendly unwind among the three for his looks at Connor with intense distrust when they first meet.</p>

        <p>Recently I’m so surprised to find myself truly begin to enjoy the study life in BCA. Before, every day was just too tired since I’m comparing with others all the time and are commonly anxious. But now, I think I’ve relatively stopped myself from constant comparing through forcing myself to ignore others, and that effectively works. More importantly, I now find everything useful which can benefit and application to a great extent. I’d like to do the comparative literacy in the future meanwhile I actively put much more concentration on my Mandarin classes. All the ancient works-<em>Qian Zi Wen</em> and poems from Li Bai, are so enjoyable that I feel like when myself know my true purpose exactly and truly want to achieve it, I would try my best towards it happily. Also for the BC courses, I may have been underestimated Drama. I had no idea that this course is so useful, which surprises me a lot indeed. I thought it was just about acting and being confident, however it also offers so many skills which can improve my spoken English and presentation behaviors. First of all, we learnt how to breathe properly which can increase lung capacity and improve the property of our speaking. Mrs. Smith offered us a meditation time, and all of us began to being focus on breathing following the arranged pace. Then she plays a safe and sound music and starts telling soft and comforting words slowly. I remembered this one, which touched me a lot: it doesn’t matter if you play video games or watch movies. As long as you are happy, everything would be perfectly enough. It’s true one day we must face the cruel society with no sympathy, but BCA is always our home which eternally covers and loves us kids. And these two days we are studying the six vocal skills, namely enunciation, projection, pace, tone, emphasis, pitch. That is exactly I want and how helpful and great this course is! Sometimes it is difficult for me to pronounce clearly, and Mrs. Smith tell us helpful tricks like eliminating “g” and practicing pronunciation in front of a mirror while watching how our mouths acting. I believe that would definitely help me improve spoken English. </p>
<p>The happiest thing for this period is that I gradually achieve the goal which seemed impossible and hopeless before: enjoy all I’m studying.</p>

        <p>In the part 1 quiz, there was a question asked about “why does Connor initially grab lev on the highway?”. And the answer for that turned to be “He wants to have a hostage.” rather than “He wants to use him as a shield from the bullets.” However, my initial answer ought to be Connor’s later purpose. So in order to avoid bullets and being arrest, when Connor saw Lev by accident, he decides to have a hostage. I think it is difficult to choose the right one according to the last paragraph, but Connor was initially running by just grabbing Lev rather than using him as a shield. Also, Lev initially thought that “he wants a hostage.” So the writer may be is implying Connor’s intension in the last paragraph. But still I think both sides can be argued since the cops are shooting tranquilizer bullets before Connor grabbed Lev so considering Lev as a shield initially can also be rational.</p>

        <p>To end the bloody and long Second Civil War, also known as “The Heartland War”, a set of constitutional amendments known as “The Bill of Life” was passed: It satisfied both the Pro-life and the Pro-choice armies (everyone has the right to decide whether to have the children or not). The Bill of Life states that human life may not be touched from the moment of conception until a child reaches the age of thirteen. However, between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, a parent may choose to retroactively “abort “ a child…on the condition that the child’s life doesn’t “technically” end. The process by which a child is both terminated and yet kept alive is called “unwinding”.</p>
<p>Although many kids got tattoos, Connor Lassiter never even got one. Ariana’s comforting words let Connor feel better although he is unconfident towards surviving to 18 and the unwinding day will come within a week. They sat on the dangerous ledge of a freeway overpass, hidden behind an exit sign. For Connor, “life on edge is home.”, which I think anticipates his later destiny. He only took Ariana here and did not feel boiled about his parents anymore–even beyond boiled because there’s nothing more to fight about with his parents due to the done unwind order. Although Connor acted like a bad boy at school, but he was still afraid to do something really serious, like kicking-AWOL. He doesn’t know whether he had the nuts so clearly, for Connor himself, he is some kind of helpless to fight back. However Ariana’s promise made Connor raise courage so made up his mind. Ariana’s parents do not like him because he’s been in and out of disciplinary school and Connor still believed they would go together for hiding. Connor found the unwind order copy coincidently and hid his emotions to avenge. However he felt no better in making his parents suffer for three weeks and even starts to feel bad about that. Clearly, Connor still loved and cared about his parents even after the unwind order is signed and he just wanted their apologies and everything would even be ok then. But his parents’ coldness blew out Connor’s last hope and care towards them. He thought he still had Ariana to keep company, but he’s wrong. From the moment his parents signed those papers, he is alone, always, because some sweet dreams would not come true, and there’s no true understanding between Connor and Ariana.</p>
<p>For Risa and Connor, they both have something in common: a close or sweet trust, however along with shallow understanding and feeling hurts.</p>
<p>It is also very interesting to notice that Lev had the desire to be the center of attention. He believes that giving himself is the ultimate blessing.</p>

        <p>Recently I’m studying a recording related to increase self-control.</p>
<p>firstly, sometimes we find it easy to deal with peers in school while the reverse is true when you at home with your family. That is because our self-control is limited. So I do not need to force myself to do everything I don’t like. In other words, “save” some self-control for vital stuff.</p>
<p>Researchers found out that gorillas can surprisingly control themselves better than high school elites when facing a table of snacks. And that is because people is often ahead: I should eat them now for they may be taken away a few minutes later, while the gorillas only care about presence. That reminds me to focus on current action to reduce disruption to self-control. The speaker also mentioned that put objects like phone that scatter your mind really helps.</p>
<p>And more importantly, he mentioned a common situation that happens on me. I always reward myself when making progress. However, ultimately I even become more inefficient. Note, what I should always focus on ought to be the goal only, rather than any progress made. Next time, think twice before we decide to reflex before the accomplish of task. </p>
<p>By the way, to control ourselves, we also need to enhance concentration. One of the good way to achieve this hope is to experience meditation for a few minutes everyday.</p>

        <p>In the parallel universe, some well-known mythical civilizations really exist. There’s a kingdom full of gold called El Dorado, once upon the time a girl of which fell in love with the king of Shambhala, the mystical kingdom hidden behind the snowy peaks of Himalayas, so they gave birth to our superhero–Dorje.</p>
<p>Naturally, this young prince owns a super mixed power as a gift for connecting the two kingdoms, which is the ability to control gold when chanting Buddhist scriptures. That’s why El Dorado’s stolen wealth can always be recaptured. But he also has a secret power unknown to the others.</p>
<p>And by the way, you may think Dorje has got a weird name, but there’s something extraordinary about it indeed. In Tibetan, “Dorje” refers to diamond, which reflects his good traits like frugal, tenacious and intrepid. However, he is also pathetically distant and exclusive due to the loss of mother in his infancy.</p>
<p>I think “superhero”, this honorary title is well deserved for Dorje takes up the duty of eliminating greed rather than enjoying the joyous and carefree life in Shambhala when greedy rulers invaded El Dorado to make a fortune. And more importantly, he protects the two historic and precious civilizations by utilizing his hidden power eventually to conceal them from the world. So being a superhero not only requires power. For Dorje, he is responsible for both his subjects and ancient civilizations. All he has done makes him a legend.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>When watching <em>The Social Network,</em> I recall my current study of wellness in terms of alcohol, the abuse of which is definitely a serious issue. Last semester’s wellness presentation told me that its effects can be positive or negative, and the latter is about weakening immunity, damaging heart health, and causing death etc. </p>
<p>According to the film, Mark Zuckerberg writes an insulting post on his LiveJournal blog which is about his ex-girlfriend Erica Albright who has just dumped him and keeps drinking beer simultaneously. The alcohol outrages resentment and then Zuckerberg creates a website called Facemash which allows visitors to rate their attractive campus girls. It seems like the alcohol issue is neglected and getting even worse: Zuckerberg’s friend Billy even begins drinking together with him and offers an “excellent” idea of posting some “horrendous” images from social network next to pictures of farm animals and let others vote on who is hotter! Zuckerberg’s hasty behavior matches the consequence of abusing alcohol, which is “perform dares that I wouldn’t dare to think about when I’m sober” according to a short video from my peers’ presentation. Apparently, over-drinking gets Zuckerberg into trouble. He suffers from six months of academic probation as punishment and loses Erica’s heart forever.</p>
<p>An improved way to approach the issue rather than “take it easy” and indulging oneself is to make a long-term plan actively to help abstinence. Many people, like Zuckerberg, keep abusing alcohol because they seldom or are difficult to make up their mind to stop drinking. That’s why they need a regular abstinence plan run in couples of months with certain incentives. They cannot control themselves completely, so need quite a long time to form the no-drinking habit gradually. Also, the incentives like watching a scientific movie stimulate the motivation to carry on. </p>
