        <p>Committee: UNEP</p>
<p>Country: The People’s republic of China</p>
<p>Topic: Reaching Net Zero Emissions: Technologies for Emission Reduction and Carbon Removal</p>
<p>Nowadays, the world economy and industry rely on fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) predominantly. Nevertheless, they bring advancements to diverse departments along with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, in terms of global warming attributed to greenhouse effect and eventually, all the factors leading to climate change. Unfortunately, the significance of the limitation of global warming (1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius) was emphasized in 2018 according to United Nation’s IPCC, that is, even an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius could spell disasters for ecosystems. Thereby to avoid the dreadful prospect, human carbon dioxide is essential to achieve net zero based on the analysis of IPCC, indicating that the GHG emissions for the coming thirty years need to go through a declining trend. Since human beings are facing such a tough situation, governments all over the world need to take the investments towards relevant technologies and cooperation strategies into consideration. We are representing China to attend today’s meeting.</p>
<p>As the biggest developing country in the world, China is also the most dominant emitter (28% of global emissions). Due the late development of industry, the people’s republic of China is eager to catch up with developed countries like the UK so that more greenhouse gases above the ordinary level have been released throughout the decades. It has become one of the main providers of industrial goods, but it is also threatening the climate. However, China is now making strides to promote renewable energy. Energy from renewable resources has composed 25% of China’s needs with a total amount more than any country in the world. In conclusion, China are curbing our carbon footprint and fully understand the importance ecosystem so would work on the eco-decisions. In comparison, those well-developed nations with good environmental consciousness are responsible to assist others in creating net zero emission. Therefore, it is very unwise for the America to back away from the Paris Agreement and deny climate change as a source of superpower. The US’s actions are counter to what’ve accomplished by the entire world so that Americans need to go through a profound consideration towards how to maintain a continuous development and in this way the whole worlds could eventually solve emission problems together.</p>
<p>To improve the world-wide situation, China suggest international acts. Environmental Conference would be of great significance to help negotiate and pass solutions from a comprehensive diverse view. The conferee could achieve win-win strategies that foster the efficiency of global executives. For instance, it’s effectively for scientists from various countries to research more about inhibitor. Multiphoton microscopy experiments have demonstrated the rapid cellular uptake of the inhibitor, which is beneficial and cost-saving for declining carbon emission. Also, for sure the world cannot just rely on a small group of people. A top down idea must be connected to intangible methods which finally come to the grass root. Education is definitely a fabulous proposal to make sure even children have the consciousness to reduce pollution. Such lectures and publicity should be considered on the agenda. Cooperating with neighbors is always our pleasure. China are willing to share own resources and academic results with friends as a little bit contribution to ecosystem. Our plans include sending expects and new technologies abroad, e.g. the prevention and control of desertification.</p>

        <p>“Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Mommy! Of course. Take care!”</p>
<p>The woman was waving at her daughter, watching the train leave the station. A clammy wind blew up, freezing me up instantly. I lay on the bench, envious and lonely. Two months ago, my parents were dead in a big fire. This happened so rapidly that the abrupt pain worked like alcohol, numbing my nerves. No relatives and property were left except a few clothes. The train station was considered as my temporary shelter. I began to beg for food two weeks ago, however giving it up because of burnout. Currently, I was thinking about how to get over the starvation as I would never give up my life facilely. There were bound to be some methods of getting food money without begging.</p>
<p>I had a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>No, it was vicious, definitely.</p>
<p>For the next hour, World War III broke out in my brain. The crazy idea came into my mind time after time, frustrating me. It was a moral violation! Mom always said I was a virtuous girl. Her words lingered in my ears, a long time cannot be dispersed. But nothing was left for me now, besides I would return it back in the end… Then I took out my cellphone slowly.</p>
<p>I was sorry, nonetheless I wanted to survive.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I dialed a casual number.</p>
<p>“Du…”my cellphone began to warn like an alarm. My heart beat violently, as if all the surroundings were staring at me, preparing to expose my crime.</p>
<p>A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>That voice must be a lady’s.</p>
<p>“Umm, I—”<br> “Hang on a second. I told you I cannot afford these cosmetics! Please get out .”</p>
<p>I stopped immediately. How could I cheat the poor lady for money? But before I hang up the phone, she continued—</p>
<p>“Forgive me, sometimes salesmen can be extremely annoying you know. So, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Umm, madam,” I whispered, “Your child is my friend—”</p>
<p>“You mean Hyacinth?”</p>
<p>“S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Hyacinth, you definitely know that! What a perfect name! In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…”</p>
<p> “Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and—is she at home now?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the lady fell silent. </p>
<p>“No. She is not here.”</p>
<p> “Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help!” I had tried my best to shout out anxiously and was just about to explain the trouble more specifically, to my surprise, the lady replied without doubting.</p>
<p> “She needs money, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” I mustered the courage to make myself sound steadfast.</p>
<p>Another silence seemed like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.</p>
<p>“I will definitely give enough money to people in need.”</p>
<p>“I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter!” Despite I am the person in need coincidently, I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>“You know,” suddenly said the lady, “You must be a girl with a kind heart, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.”</p>
<p>“Not really…”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.”</p>
<p>I felt a familiar warmth inside, so real that nearly made me cry out.</p>
<p>“It’s just a duty to care about minors.”</p>
<p>My nose stung. Tears stood in my dull eyes.</p>
<p>“If you accept, let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.”</p>
<p>I could not control my feeling anymore. All the lies crumbled—</p>
<p>“Madam! I’m sorry. What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be alive! You are the only person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.” </p>
<p>“My dear child,” The lady chuckled, “This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the ‘wicked’ idea has been defeated by your conscience.”</p>
<p>Her words melted my ice-cold heart. In place of tears, there was the beginning of a smile. “I… appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?”</p>
<p>“She won’t be back.”</p>
<p>“How—how can it be?”</p>
<p>“She died three days ago.” </p>
<p>Another silence, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p>“My condolences.”</p>
<p>“That’s ok.”</p>
<p>“You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.”</p>
<p>I could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Mommy.”</p>
<p>Psalm 25 says, “Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.” Nothing can beat kindness, for it has magic to keep you away from evil. Above all, kindness resonates among us. A prosperous and steady society depends on nothing but kindness. I’ve got a new home, sweet and cozy. Thank god, someone appeared in my despair, beautiful as viridescent hyacinths.</p>
