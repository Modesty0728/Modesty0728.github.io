        <p>Neal Shusterman once stated in Unwind Dystology Book 3 that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” (186) Contemporary people are starting to embrace distinct beauty standards. However, South Korean male stars seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups when appearing on public occasions, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. As a matter of fact, people are not concealing the emperor’s body of masculinity by claiming the presence of the clothes of femininity—instead the emperor is placed safe and sound in their “instinct zone” where the judgement of femininity is formed. In other words, the truth is not ignored—it only needs some thinking to emerge. Back to reality, the fact is that people ought to be ready for a combat to eliminate the “blind spot” in order to rehabilitate K-pop male stars: they should not be cosmetically defined traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>Simply, if someone is trying to judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of “femininity”, check its definition! According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards e.g. milky skin and dyed hair, was drowned by audience’s saliva. Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to update the definition of femininity in aims of catering to the “2021 status quo”. So, how did the South Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition which also infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots. Cosmetics plausibly grew as the pressure solver. Overall, the society is evolving so that what were viewed “typically out of style” are now “suitably with the times”. So, can the K-pop male stars be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the current version of definition.</p>
<p>The necessary redefinition of femininity gives a chance to the evolution of masculinity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appears in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, can be seen as a “flower boy” superficially, however meanwhile he is strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service. This fully indicates the interpretation of machismo. Only what they choose to look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” owing to abdominals which is not counted in female beauty standards. At the end of day, cosmetics can only <strong>soften</strong> facial features—or, at deeper level—part of the masculine quality, with no relation to femininity. </p>
<p>To make a final statement, the so-called “femininity trend” actually arises from the similarities between K-pop males and females. Take beauty standards as an example. Fair skin is required for both men and female (other factors mainly focus on particular gender characteristics, e.g. small lovely noses for women). Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers from different genders while offering treatments that personify the same beauty standard. In this way, is it the males that are imitating the females? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% of South Korean total population are foreigners. In a children chorus composed of local kids only, boys and girls are always uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. First of all, facial features are in a likeness. Additionally, the makeup is the same. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics and also plastic surgeries apparently that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully the “male trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p>Remember: read through the definition carefully, and then be aware of the particularity of South Korean culture and everyone’s freedom in choosing how they look. At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance instinctively which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since that means that they fail the equality between men and women.</p>

        <p>List of characters:</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> A sly guy who plays a trick on Red Riding Hood in order to kill she and her grandma for food.</p>
<p><strong>WOODCUTTER.</strong> A gallant and righteous men who save RRD and grandma from the wolf.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—The forest:</strong></p>
<p><em>(setting: a thriving forest where the crystal blue sky and sunshine vanish. The air is moggy. The ground is covered with fallen dark green leaves. Despite a faint scent, the stench is still conspicuous if you get a sensitive nose. Some rotting dead bodies are lying behind the oak roots.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silently but notably, a wolf with hostile and sly eyes lets his head out behind the oak, watching Red Riding Hood bouncing cheerfully towards north)</em></p>
<p><strong>RED RIDING HOOD (RRH).</strong> How nice the flowers smell! (<em>Pause.</em>) Something also smells odd in the air…maybe just my illusion (<em>grin.</em>) After all mom’s rotten eggs are so smelly!</p>
<p>​    (<em>the wolf steps out.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> (<em>smirk.</em>) Hello! My dear! Such a nice day, uh? </p>
<p><strong>RRH.</strong> (<em>startled.</em>) Oh, it’s you, Mr. Wolf? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> Ha, free Sunday, nothing to do! What about you dear? Where are you heading for wearing such a cute hood? (<em>wink.</em>) I can get you accompanied…you know…in such a dangerous forest.</p>
<p>​    (<em>RRD tends to nod, but hesitate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(to the audience, whisper.)</em> My mom told me to be ignorant to the stranger.</p>
<p>​    <em>（**wolf seems to have the ability of telepathy.**）</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(put his arm around RRD’s shoulder.)</em> I know your concern dear. It’s really unsafe for you to walk in the dark forest with a stranger like me. Why not tell me your destination, and then I will figure out whether the main big road can lead you to it or not?</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(ponder, then nod.)</em> Sure, Mr. Wolf! <em>(suddenly joyful.)</em> So generous are you! Actually, I gonna visit my grandma who lives in a hut.</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(smirk, then pretend to laugh happily.)</em> Lucky you! The main road can definitely lead you there! So don’t risk your life in here anymore hon, go now! Bless you and the dear madam!</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(touched.)</em> Cannot be more thankful. I will bring your blessing to grandma! </p>
<p>​    <em>(RRD leaves cheerfully, disappearing in the forest soon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(to the audience.)</em> You know, I’ve been hungry for such a long time.</p>
<p>​    <em>(wolf heads for the north as the speed of light.)</em></p>

        <p>Clearly there are some clashes between pro and con side. But I can tell that the it is con side that causes this situation due to your logical fallacies and vague comprehension towards nearly everything, generally five points:</p>
<p>\0. There are actually <strong>two ways</strong> of dealing with nuclear leak, which means that what we have all said about ocean pollution, the fisherman can be totally avoided.</p>
<p>\1.   Nuclear energy is not as dangerous as you said—and even safer than driving a car. So why don’t you just worry about whether you should allow FP to drive a car?</p>
<p>\2.   Nuclear power plants are not responsible for protecting native culture, since it is the cultural department in the government that should take in charge.</p>
<p>\3.   Shut down power plants will not save the natural resources. Without provided nuclear energy, FP would do continuous logging. And it is so beneficial to the environment!</p>
<p>\4.   Last but not least, you have mentioned what happened in Japan right? The accidents happened just because they did not inject cool water in time. So if you are not in a coastal place, how can you ensure you can offer cool water sustainably?</p>
<p><strong>So, thank you so much for mentioning “Japan”, and “ocean” for so many times, providing us with so great examples to prove our thesis statement. And in conclusion, with great advantage in sustainability, economy, and humanity industry, we believe that nuclear power plants have a bright future in remote near-sea area. Nuclear power has been a significant character of the contemporary energy source, so we should catch up with the trend and keep abreast with the society. Above all, we can fully prove that it is possible to construct nuclear power plants. So, we can win the debate based on our framework.</strong></p>

        <p>The first day egg-drop project was assigned (April 25th) we had already started designing our final product by researching ideal materials, and eventually our brainstorms “gave birth to” 7 different ones. The first one we came up with was bubble wrap. Since “pod” was not allowed, we needed something to ensure egg’s safety. Bubble wrap was definitely a good choice because it was light, protectable, and provided egg with larger space. Then I supposed something that protected the egg most efficiently was definitely a hen. So, why not creating a fake hen…just an imagination! Hard to get it come true. Kristen also raised up with a creative idea—use soda and Mentos to form foam and gas that can send the egg safely to the ground. However, any on-the-ground equipment would not be permitted. What’s more, the irregular produced foam would intensify uncertainty—the egg was still likely to smash to the ground due to the foam’s changing shape. So, was there anything that can be both as <strong>soft</strong> as hen and meanwhile <strong>hard</strong> enough to heat the ground while surviving…? That would be the non-Newtonian fluid! When the force acting on it, it acts like solid. Through systematic research, we have learnt that it can also be called Oobleck which carries itself as a liquid when being hold still so that “flexible egg shell” would be provided. After sharing all the ideas, we asked help from the internet. There’s a popular method—a triangle brace made by straws which fixed the egg in the center. But that would probably be a “pod” or the egg would fall off. Some foreigners also used a barrel of popcorns to prevent their baby eggs from breaking apart, but popcorns may disappoint the mass requirement. And the non-Newtonian fluid may miss the “most spectacular” shoot…just a bonus anyway. This method was practical (flour + water), and also catered to all our desires. And undeniably it was creative—we did not get this idea from the internet—all came after analysis, assumption, and our common sense.</p>
<p>To carry on our expectation on non-Newtonian fluid, we decided to put it into action. We made DIY non-Newtonian fluid—the mixture of certain amount of flour (45 grams) and water (50mL). I poured flour into a square-shaped bottle, and then the water was splashed in to form the fluid, the process of which was boosted by the use of stirring rod. Finally, the egg was in, swallowed and wrapped up (the container was sealed with plastic wrap and some tape). Mom dropped the container at 4th floor. The egg survived perfectly (although with slight damage to the container). Unfortunately, the total weight was about 165 grams! Soon we found out that nearly half of the bottle’s volume was unused so that wasted. Therefore, we changed it into a long neck bottle which required less fluid around the egg, and the bottle was cut down by its “waist”, helping the egg drop in more easily. The weight was controlled around 100 grams. Before the drop day we’ve done about ten times of practice. Besides the aforementioned trials, we were still trying to provoke innovation based on the uncertain mass. We decided to “take a risk”. Use softer plastic bottle. Considering the possibility of the container falling with its “mouth” down, we also added foam net into the space between the fluid and plastic wrap.That was a frustrating night. Our container fell onto the ceiling of the elevator twice without hitting the ground…and for every time we had to make another bottle of Oobleck! Finally we even risked our lives (exaggerated), pulling ourselves half out in the air and the ground eventually greeted her baby eggs (tried another two times to ensure final success)! And the result was absolutely the same—unbroken!</p>
<p>Here came to the Egg Drop Day! We prepared the Oobleck at noon and the total container weighed 98.4 grams. Arriving at 3rd floor, the egg was dropped but surprisingly smashed into “mango yogurt” thanks to the presence of Oobleck…We both were really depressed since it was the first time that the non-Newtonian fluid failed us! However, later on, I found out the possible reason: we were nervous before the activity so wrapping the container with several layers of plastic wrap! And that actually smoothened original edges while made the container more like a ball…the “ball” rolled so the egg lost the protection of Oobleck pathetically (between the top of the container and the egg, there was no Oobleck, only foam net). To prove our suggestion, we experimented two more times after school. This time we used less tape and the plastic wrap was only around the top of container. And, we did it! The egg was actually dropped from the 3.5th floor, and for both times it survived. Correct guess! However, we were also taken 1 point away for offering a “pod”, since we did not read the instructions carefully which clarified that “jelly” would not be permitted. No matter how we believed that to come up with this idea was already very innovated. Next time just read through the whole instruction page more slowly…and anything else was great! The process matters much more than the result.</p>

        <p>It depends. People from distinct religions and regions are supporting heterogeneous beauty standards. The same fact is—people are always chasing for beauty, because nearly everyone wants to have a not-so-bad look. And that is normal, very common based on human nature. So, if we only consider the perfect beauty standards, the health and beauty industry are safe, since these represent people’s nature of admiring beauty and their ideal figures. However, what we are concerning now is the methods used to approach these standards. Friends around me would instinctively laugh at my relevantly darker skin, frequently going on diets, and even plan carefully for a future plastic surgery. I’ve always been confused. Instinctively I cannot help but disapproving their manners. But why? I mean—everyone has their rights to chase for beauty, so is this also their right to take any extreme ways to achieve their goals? Maybe it is. So why am I denying their legitimate decisions? Perhaps it is due to my instinct to stick up for “natural beauty”. I even get uncomfortable when seeing my friends infatuated with make-ups. I’ve reflected on myself for so many times. Don’t be so extreme! Don’t be so harsh on your friends if yourself do not like it! You have to understand it is others’ right! Besides, even myself once planned to purchase a bunch of Dior or Channel’s cosmetics when growing into an adolescent. Literally, I enjoyed considering about that kind of thing! That made me feel confident, as if my life was extremely colorful. I can only tell that like me, preferring nature can refer to less care in personal appearance (well I still make sure that I’m in a tidy and easeful look). It is really hard for me to answer whether striving to be pretty by using whatever possible methods is correct and rational. I can only say that there is sequential safe level for health and beauty industry. The more thoughts you put on this field, the more “risks” you are likely to take since you’ve put too much precious energy on superficial fantasy. Deep down, infinite emptiness is out of ignorance because you are not living for yourself anymore but your appearance.</p>

        <p>\1.   Main clash</p>
<p>l <strong>Safety issue</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear actually indicates the least security risks.</p>
<p>You would say that we cannot ignore a single possibility, since 1% possibility can cause irreversible health damage to living beings.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt;Rebuttal:</strong></p>
<p>the possibility of being involved in a car accident is much higher than nuclear leak.</p>
<p>Question: <em>So, do you want to change a topic? What about this one: would FP risk their lives to take a bus?</em></p>
<p><strong>Only if there is 1% possibility to be risky in safety industry, the “1% possibility” is not concerning.</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Culture issue</strong></p>
<p>When we decide to build nuclear power plants in FP nations, we would worry about their culture heritage spontaneously. It is a concerning issue indeed. It is something we need to think and worry about. We need to build the sense to protect their culture and then make our determination visible. How? Through government legislation. <strong>But that’s not what we can worry about. Now the environmental department needs to get in charge and carry one our resolution.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>-&gt;Rebuttal:</strong> </p>
<p>If you are so active caring about the loss of native culture, ok <strong>your battle target is the environmental department of the government, not us.</strong> When we come to the disappear of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which one is to blame: the pilot, or the Wright brothers? Similarly, are we the ones to blame?</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear power plants are not responsible for protecting native culture.</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Economy issue</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear plants require lower cost. </p>
<p>-&gt;In this way, benefit national economy.</p>
<p>-&gt;better protection</p>
<p><strong><em>if\</em></strong> <em>you question whether the money would be used on protection project,</em> (I can tell you that whether or not to do so is also related to legislation rather than the construction of plants. if you wanna get into the topic of legislation, infinite questions would follow, and I bet you can answer none of them) <em>Why don’t you ask more questions like “whether the legislators are holding justice?”, or “will the legislator use the money to buy thousands of hamburgers if they are starving?”</em></p>
<p>l <strong>Environment issue</strong></p>
<p>Without nuclear energy, FP do continuous logging. And that is so beneficial to the environment! FP should be thankful for being offered a convenient chance of using nuclear energy</p>
<p>\2.   Location necessary </p>
<p>è <strong>Near sea</strong></p>
<p>!! We need <strong>tons of cold water</strong> to cool down the fuel rods inside the nuclear reactors</p>
<p>*世界超半数所有核反应堆都在海边，不在海边的周围也有大量水源。</p>
<p>*日本核泄漏后导致爆炸的主要原因就是<strong>未及时注入冷水，可见cool water的重要性！！</strong></p>
<p>！！wind energy: toxic gases dissipate in the atmosphere (苏联切尔诺贝利事件有毒粉尘飘到了瑞典)</p>
<p>è <strong>Remote</strong></p>
<p>Everyone is equal indeed. So, which one means less damage: kill one person or kill a country of person?</p>
<p>-&gt;I know you would say, “what happened in Japan indicates that the damage is going to people around the world, not just the people living near plants!”</p>
<p>   -&gt;ok, so you are even confused about the basic facts: Japanese could totally choose to bury those waste water deep down into ground, which is one of the two ways of dealing with nuclear leak (another one is discharging it into ocean) Japan chose the former due to the latter’s huge opportunity cost. </p>
<p>\3.  direct benefits to FP</p>
<p>l <strong>Modernization</strong></p>
<p>l <strong>Offer working opportunities (job)</strong></p>

        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile. However, Risa and Connor seem to come from two planets more often than not— “isolation” and “separateness” are conspicuous. So, is it only their common goal of staying alive that binds them? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? Through thorough reading, it is not hard to register that the affection between Risa and Connor springs up owing to both their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>One of Risa and Connor’s “few” similarities is the perfect interpretation of the Admiral’s supreme rules—especially for “rise to the occasion”. The duo head for a bus stop tacitly at the instant when a police car appears, which indicates that they have been “molded” into coherent “underground workers”, and meanwhile are flexible enough to utilize surroundings as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Comparatively, the couple’s escaping plan is also coolly probative. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing back cops, followed by rushing onto the interstate. Risa does the same except for the details— her destination is a forest and there’s no one blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In these cases, they are both holding abundant intention towards surviving, so even though chances come in a hurry that could simultaneously wither away, they will succeed to grab it. Clearly, Risa and Connor are naturals in finding out the first priority, which makes them “excellent” AWOLs. This facilitates the first step of love—mutual appreciation.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that the lovers have grown fearless. Back to the days at State Home, Risa shuddered when being order to “satisfy” budget cuts, almost involuntarily asking for other professions. Similarly, Connor needed Ariana to light up his courage when facing the danger of unwinding. they were too intimidated by the prospect compared with what happens to them later: Risa becomes a pianist in Happy Jack Harvest Camp while Connor ultimately walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Having gone through so many life and death tests, now they take it easy. At least they have tried, leaving no regret. Risa and Connor stand the test of time so a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are truly ready for love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will their emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Well, they own distinct characteristics. It is like a battle between ice and fire when referring to “rational versus emotional”. Connor constantly causes trouble as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Conversely his girlfriend is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland—even after the “Bathroom Event”. She is also sober enough to scan the danger of taking that new-born baby and then try her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like whether diverse emotions can be effectively controlled or not is the key difference between the couple, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, their characteristics gradually interweave afterwards— Risa begins to care about Connor instead of keeping distance, and Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they growing more and more intimate with each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t mean “identical”. The similarities between couples can only get them qualified and prepared for love. Tried-and-true love will appear only if both sides build a bridge over any existing gap, since that demonstrates great efforts for love, rather than illusion of romance. Between Risa and Connor love obtains the sublimation and the eternal.</p>

        <ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a supporting character in Disney’s story <em>Cinderella</em>, the physical embodiment of hope. I am Cinderella’s godmother. I always appear suddenly in the thin air with twinkling lights (sparkly confetti), wearing a gown with two wings shaking behind her back and a wand (can be summoned from nothingness) at the end of which is grafted a shiny tin foil star. I’m so warm-hearted that I could not bear any unfair. So, I offer poor Cinderella a little bit of help…make her princess dream come true: a dress and a tiara. In fairy tales, I’m “a fairy with magical powers who acts as a mentor or parent to someone, in the role that an actual godparent was expected to play in many societies.” I stand for children’s fantasies about magic, and “whenever events are right for a fairy tale to recur, I steps in to make sure that the tale in question runs its course with as few fatalities as possible.” I wouldn’t appear to Ella if she loses her faith. Actually, I did not appear until Cinderella was at her weakest point. So, I won’t offer my help casually. I would only appear if Ella keeps a kind heart, which is strong enough to summon me, and just need a little bit of magic to push her to what she deserves. I like magic, Cinderella’s happiness, and books. What I dislike are hopelessness, unhappiness, and losing my wand! And I’m always in an active status. My wand holds incredible power, such as metamorphosis and the ability to warp reality among others. However, its magic is not exclusive to me as mortals can also use it (can be either good or evil however). However, despite my sweetness I do not sympathize with those who are unforgiving towards others. I also have a connection with my wand (they call it “telepathy”).</p>
<h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Disney film version, although I would suddenly appear in the thin air, I’m always watching Cinderella secretly, caring about her and her original family (Ella’s parents both are gone now). But when Ella summons me, I would come to her wherever she is.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Twinkling lights (sparkly confetti) is always surrounding me when I show up out of thin air. Besides, Cinderella is with me, together with two white horses, a driver, a footman, and a carriage which are produced by me.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the evening. After Cinderella’s abusers left. Before the ball gets started.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m equipped with a magical wand. I was appointed be to Cinderella’s fairy godmother. I am summoned by Cinderella since she hasn’t lost her faith even when she is at her weakest point.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m Cinderella’s godmother. As a fairy godmother, I am also children’s beacon of hope.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want Cinderella to go to the ball. I want Cinderella happy. I want Cinderella to always keep her faith.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>My precious wand can also be used by bad people. When magic is used as dark force, I would probably lose my job!! And the whole world would get messed up.  So, my wand is my pressure, but also my obstacle as well. What’s more, I only have the magic to show up out of the air and summon my wand without using my pressure. Besides this obstacle, I also “tend to be comically absent-minded, continuously loses sight of the obvious, and has a habit of both losing her wand and forgetting her magic words “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo">Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo</a>“.</p>
<p>Cinderella’s abusers are also big obstacles. They oppress my dear girl and nearly ruin my contribution and Ella’s sweet future in the last minute.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>To get Ella happier, I show up in time to offer her nice dress. Being aware of the stepmother’s selfishness, I was overt to make a pair of magical glass slippers as a back-up plan…and that is eventually proved to be profound and significant. </p>
