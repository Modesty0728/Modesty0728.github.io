        <p><strong>The characters</strong></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> A virtuous girl who would never give up own life facilely.</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> ME’s mother. A great woman who would risk her life to save her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> A girl who named after flowers.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> HYACINTH’s mother. She has low yearly income.</p>
<p><strong>Scene one</strong></p>
<p><em>(The outline of a building is demonstrated in the background. A wall in the middle which separates two families. The furniture and white wall are not shining anymore—big fire is spreading from downstairs. Black smoke is everywhere on stage. A big wooden bookcase is standing in the left corner while the family on the right has a bed placed besides the middle wall. Loads of blood-donation certificates are scattered on nightstand. A bottle of water tips over, spilling water out.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*MOM *trying to find a towel for</em> ME <em>to cover nose. On the other side of the stage,</em> HYACINTH <em>is awakened by stifling toxic gases.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Honey, come this way! <em>(point at the backstage)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(cough)</em> Don’t wait for me! Go! <em>(Fire dances to be a dividing line between</em> MOM <em>and</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p>​    <em>(*HYACINTH *is off the bed, frightened)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> <em>(weep)</em> where are you mama?</p>
<p><em>(*HYACINTH *picks up the bottle and tries to drive away the fire ghost by splashing the tiny amount of water left. However, that only makes herself surrounded by a fire circle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(already near the backstage, wave at</em> ME*)* Come on! Dear!</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(continue coughing)</em> I can’t get to you… </p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *collapses.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> No! Sweetheart!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *maneuvers across the fire wall. Successfully, she gets to her unconscious daughter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> Oh, please! <em>(desperate)</em> Wake up! Wake up! <em>(gently and then rapidly shake</em> ME*)*</p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> Help! Help! Anymore hear me? Please! <em>(harms around herself)</em></p>
<p><em>(The fire is approaching</em> HYACINTH. She climbs on her bed, although she knows that won’t help either.<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> HELP!!! <em>(kiss ME’s cheek)</em> I won’t leave you. Never.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The fire starts to suffocate</em> MOM*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hard to breathe)</em> You are the most virtuous girl in the world. And I always know that. <em>(tears cannot stop falling down)</em> </p>
<p><em>(Fire is now eating</em> HYACINTH’<em>s pajamas.</em> HYACINTH <em>is threatened into the corner and can no longer struggle anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HYACINTH.</strong> I guess this is the end. <em>(grin)</em> Mama, I love you, and I remember to have courage and be kind in my last moment… <em>(weaker and weaker)</em> Forgive *(whisper)*…me…</p>
<p>   <em>(*HYACINTH *is swallowed by fire. She is gone)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(almost faint)</em> Mom is here. <em>(pat</em> ME<em>’s pack)</em> No need to be afraid.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, the bookcase in the corner shakes violently, tending to fall onto the ground. It is heading for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(yell)</em> No!!!!!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *throws herself over ME. The bookcase falls on her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> <em>(hysterical)</em> Ugh— </p>
<p>   <em>(Her hands drop down slowly from</em> ME<em>’s body.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM.</strong> (mumble) Hope someone will love you as I do.</p>
<p>​    **(**MOM is dead.)</p>
<p><strong>End of scene one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene two</strong></p>
<p><em>(The background still remains the same. The middle wall disappears. Now we only focus on the family on the left. The furniture has turned into ruins. Beside sparks lies the ember. The bookcase holds its position.)</em></p>
<p><em>(*ME’s fingers *start to move. At first,</em> ME <em>is stuck by something heavy above her.</em> ME <em>musters forces to climb out of the “mountain”.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> What’s so heavy?! <em>(get free eventually)</em></p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *sees</em> MOM <em>not moving anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(joking)</em> Mommy! Don’t imitate me anymore! <em>(smirk)</em> Such a bad day…ok, I’m totally fine now. See? Come on! <em>(baby voice)</em> Hug me! </p>
<p>​    <em>(*MOM *doesn’t sink into</em> ME<em>’s arms.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Mom! <em>(start to panic)</em> Speak to me! <em>(violently shake the pale body)</em></p>
<p>​    <strong><em>(\</em></strong>ME <em>notices the blood on the back of the head of</em> MOM.<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> NO, no, no, no, no… <em>(Facial expressions are distorted.)</em> </p>
<p>​    <em>(<em>ME</em>’s eyes are dilated with horror. Trembling,</em> ME <em>tests the heartbeat.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(hysterical)</em> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <em>(stumble on</em> MOM*)* NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! <em>(embrace and grovel on</em> MOM<em>’s dead body)</em></p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *walls and weeps for a long time.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(sob)</em> Come back…please…COME BACK!</p>
<p>​    (ME <em>shakes the body again and again. Nothing happens.</em> ME <em>cannot stop crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(convulsive)</em> You said you will always by my side…You…you said you will never let me suffer…You said you are always there to hug me…Why tell the lies, mommy? Why leave me here to suffer alone? I miss the viridescent hyacinths you used for decoration…I miss your kiss…I miss you voice. Come back! Cook breakfast for me! How dare you forget about that? I will die without you. Are you willing to see that? Mom…HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE ON???</p>
<p>​    <em>(The ceiling begins shaking. The building is collapsing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I don’t wanna go…I won’t leave you.</p>
<p>​    <em>(Bricks begins to fall down.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh, no! <em>(astonished)</em> I must leave!</p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *looks around. Everything is in dust. No cashes. No warm clothes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh my goodness what can depend on?</p>
<p>​    <em>(*ME *stares at</em> MOM<em>’s coat.</em> ME <em>hesitates for a while.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Sorry mom.</p>
<p>​    <em>(The whole ceiling begins to fall down.</em> ME <em>takes the coat, with no courage to deliver</em> MOM <em>another glimpse.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>End of scene two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene three</strong></p>
<p><em>(A clammy wind blew up which seems to dim the glittering train station. A luxurious cosmetics store is seated at the right half of the stage with its front door facing the right backstage and backwall halving the stage so that people in the left stage cannot see what happened on the other side at all. A wooden bench covered with fallen leaves is placed in the left half besides the railway. A clock ticktocks in the middle of the background, beneath which a sign reads “Welcome to MOTHERLY STATION</em>—<em>remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart!”)</em></p>
<p><em>(Wearing an ill-fitting coat,</em> ME <em>is frozen up.</em> ME <em>lies on the bench, envious and lonely. Young ladies’ exhilarating laughter lingers around the station.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(weak and pale)</em> There… are… bound <em>(pound the bench with a trembling fist)</em> to be some </p>
<p>methods of getting food money without begging…</p>
<p><em>(Train flashes by.</em> ME <em>had a flash of inspiration.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> No, no it was… <em>(pause)</em> vicious, definitely.</p>
<p><em>(World War III broke out in my brain.)</em></p>
<p><em>(a recording is played at the backstage: “You are such a virtuous girl!”, lingering around the stage.</em> ME <em>heads up instantly with tears and also a sense of guilty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> But… nothing is left for me now, mom… <em>(wipe the tears away)</em> Please forgive me. I don’t </p>
<p>care who I am anymore… I only want to live… on! <em>(firm but struggling)</em> And I would return it </p>
<p>back in the end… The virtuous girl is gone.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *takes out my cellphone slowly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I’m sorry.</p>
<p><em>(Taking a deep breath,</em> ME <em>dials a casual number.</em> <em>“Du—”</em> ME<em>’s cellphone began to alarm.</em> ME <em>looks around nervously, pressing on heart with ragged breathing.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A voice interrupted the terrifying atmosphere. It is from the cosmetics store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Umm, I— </p>
<p><em>(A lady steps out of the store reluctantly, clinging on to her muddy cloak which seems to come from the opposite world of the brightly lit luxury store.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(whisper)</em> So Sorry. Hang on a second. <em>(turn to the store)</em> I’ve already </p>
<p>told you that I can afford none of these!</p>
<p><em>(*ME *freezes, and then painfully closes eyes in self-accusation while giving</em> <em>herself a slap. But before</em> ME <em>hangs up the phone,</em> MIDDLE-AGED LADY <em>continued—)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(take a deep breath, and grin)</em> Forgive me, dear. You know </p>
<p><em>(optimistic)</em> salesmen can be extremely annoying sometimes. So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(frustrated and guilty)</em> Umm, uh…madam… <em>(inhale deeply)</em> your child is my friend—</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You mean Hyacinth?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(guilty look)</em> S…sorry, would you mind speaking a little bit louder?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> I mean, Hyacinth! You definitely know that! What a perfect name! <em>(lost in memory)</em> In fact viridescent hyacinths represent kindness…</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Oh—exactly! Your daughter, that’s right, she is my friend, and *(tentative)*—is she at home now?</p>
<p>(Suddenly MIDDLE-AGED LADY falls silent.)</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> No. She is not here.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Madam, Hyacinth is in trouble now and is badly in need of financial help! She— <em>(ME have tried best to shout out anxiously.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(decisive)</em> She needs money, right?</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(pretend to be steadfast)</em> Yes.</p>
<p>​    <em>(Silence seems like the peace before the erupting of a volcano.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(ponder)</em> I will definitely give enough money to people in need.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I convey my appreciation to you for your daughter! </p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> You know, <em>(suddenly)</em> you must be a virtuous girl, for you turn to me for help instantly when my daughter met difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Not really…</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Whatever you say, but I’d like to consider you, the friend of Hyacinth, as my own daughter.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *nearly cries out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s just a duty to care about minors.</p>
<p><em>(Tears stood in</em> ME<em>’s eyelashes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> If you accept, <em>(step forward)</em> let me be your second mother, protecting you till the end.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *cannot stop crying.</em> ME <em>covered mouth with hands in order to make no sounds while the whole body is rapidly shaking.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(release)</em> Madam! I’m sorry!! What I said were all made up to cheat you for money! I ought to be put into prison, but I just want to be <em>(pause)</em> alive. You are the only <em>(snap)</em> person being nice to me after my parents’ deaths. I’m a bad girl humiliating your kindness. I will go to the police myself.</p>
<p>​    <em>(*MIDDLE-AGED LADY *is gratified.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Dear child <em>(chuckle)</em>, This is what I’m waiting for. You have admitted your shame. For me, that’s enough. Don’t define yourself as a fraud, ever, because the “wicked” idea has been defeated by your conscience.</p>
<p><em>(In place of tears, there is the beginning of a smile for</em> ME*.)*</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> I… <em>(wipe tears away and look gratefully at the black silk sky)</em> appreciate and admire you… more than I can say. Can I send my respects to your daughter as well?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> <em>(pause)</em> She won’t be back.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> How—how can it be?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> She died three days ago. </p>
<p><em>(Silence falls, longer than the shut-eye of Sleeping Beauty.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> <em>(unbelievable)</em> You’ve identified my true purpose in the beginning, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Yep. I was trying to give you a helping hand in life, and leading you to the right track, if possible. You are guilty, but I’m sincere. I’ve considered you as my second daughter indeed.</p>
<p><em>(*ME *could say nothing but letting tears flow freely.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> Don’t forget you’ve got a new home. </p>
<p>​    <em>(Pause. They both look up to see the sign.)</em></p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED LADY.</strong> It’s getting colder and colder outside. Remember to wear more clothes, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ME.</strong> Of course. <em>(pause)</em> Mommy.</p>

        <p>Neal Shusterman once stated in Unwind Dystology Book 3 that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” (186) Contemporary people are starting to embrace various beauty standards. However, South Korean male stars seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups when appearing on public occasions, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. As a matter of fact, people are not concealing the emperor’s “masculine body” by claiming the presence of the “feminine clothes”—instead he is placed safe and sound in their “instinct zone” where the judgement of femininity is formed. In other words, the truth is not ignored—it only needs some thought to emerge. Back to reality, the fact is that people ought to be ready for a combat to eliminate the “blind spot” in order to rehabilitate K-pop male stars: they should not be cosmetically defined traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>Simply, if someone is trying to judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of “femininity”, check the word’s definition! It shows the limitation of convention. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nothing specific about cosmetics is set as the standard to tell genders apart. And what if something is changing after a “long time”? Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards i.e. milky skin and dyed hair, was almost drowned by audience’s saliva (Yi, David). Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to cater to the “2021 status quo”. What seems acceptable now was once against the tradition. Therefore, how did the Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition. It infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots (Yi, David). Cosmetics plausibly grow to be the pressure solver. Overall, the society is evolving so that what were viewed “out of style” are now “suitably” or “untraditionally” with the times. It is an innovation. Should the K-pop male stars be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the current version of definition which only focuses on the convention. </p>
<p>Time is going on. If the definition of femininity is restricted conventionally, then masculinity must step forward. In other words, the concept of soft masculinity appears because of the negation of traditional femininity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appearing in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, can be seen as a “flower boy” superficially, however he was also strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). This fully indicates the moral interpretation of machismo—bravery and decisiveness. It seems like only what their faces look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” owing to abdominals which are not counted in female beauty standards (Flowerboys and the appeal of ‘soft masculinity’ in South Korea). Once again, only the cosmetic complexions are so controversial—other physical features are in the safety zone of masculinity. However, at the end of day, cosmetics can only <strong>soften</strong> facial features, with no relation to femininity because of what is beneath the skin with cosmetics.</p>
<p>To make a final statement, people see how the K-pop females look, then coming to a conclusion that males are imitating. The so-called “femininity trend” actually arises from the two genders sharing some similarities, thus the conviction for femininity is null. Take beauty standards as an example. Fair skin is required for both men and female (Yi, David). Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers from different genders while offering treatments that personify the same beauty standard (Cummings, Aaron). In this way, how to overturn the assumption of imitation? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% (Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs) of South Korean total population are foreigners (Foreign Population in Korea Tops 2.5 Million). Here comes an analogy: in children’s choirs composed of local kids only, boys and girls are always uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. First of all, facial features are in a likeness (no foreigners). Additionally, the makeups are the same. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully males “trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance instinctively which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since this means that they fail the equality between men and women. Standing at two genders’ intersection, K-pop males are still themselves—the kind of person they want to be, no matter soft or hard. At the same time, femininity is also evolving. No matter how, the tradition cannot be used on those boys definitely since they are the buds of the new age, blood-soaked, in exchange for hope.</p>

        <p>Neal Shusterman once stated in Unwind Dystology Book 3 that “It’s not the emperor has no clothes. It’s that everyone’s placed him in their blind spot.” (186) Contemporary people are starting to embrace distinct beauty standards. However, South Korean male stars seem to burden much more controversies: renowned groups such as <em>Big Bang</em>, <em>EXO</em>, and <em>BTS</em> always wear heavy make-ups when appearing on public occasions, which seems quite feminine in a striking contrast to traditional male stars like Bruce Li. As a matter of fact, people are not concealing the emperor’s body of masculinity by claiming the presence of the clothes of femininity—instead the emperor is placed safe and sound in their “instinct zone” where the judgement of femininity is formed. In other words, the truth is not ignored—it only needs some thinking to emerge. Back to reality, the fact is that people ought to be ready for a combat to eliminate the “blind spot” in order to rehabilitate K-pop male stars: they should not be cosmetically defined traditionally feminine, rather versatilely masculine.</p>
<p>Simply, if someone is trying to judge whether the K-pop male idols meet the standard of “femininity”, check its definition! According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, being feminine means “having characteristics that are <strong>traditionally</strong> thought to be typical of or suitable for a woman”, while the key word “traditionally” stands by the qualities like “long time” and “without changing”. Nowadays, G-Dragon’s cosmetic complexion is seen as the epitome of K-pop stars. But back to 1991, Yang Joon-il, representing similar beauty standards e.g. milky skin and dyed hair, was drowned by audience’s saliva. Clearly, at that time South Korea had yet to update the definition of femininity in aims of catering to the “2021 status quo”. So, how did the South Koreans “bridge the huge gap” in such a fast speed? Through the pressure of competition which also infects South Koreans’ aesthetics in their youth. For instance, the employees are frequently asked to upload headshots. Cosmetics plausibly grew as the pressure solver. Overall, the society is evolving so that what were viewed “typically out of style” are now “suitably with the times”. So can the K-pop male stars be regarded as feminine? Not at least in the current version of definition.</p>
<p>The necessary redefinition of femininity gives a chance to the evolution of masculinity. The emerging “diversity” in masculinity is like a blue print to end this controversial topic. Song Joong-ki, appears in the well-known drama series <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, can be seen as a “flower boy” superficially, however meanwhile he is strong enough to lead the forces as a captain during his military service. This fully indicates the interpretation of machismo. Only what they choose to look like incur queries. More importantly, K-pop males are always “satisfying” owing to abdominals which is not counted in female beauty standards. At the end of day, cosmetics can only <strong>soften</strong> facial features—or, at deeper level—part of the masculine quality, with no relation to femininity. </p>
<p>To make a final statement, the so-called “femininity trend” actually arises from the similarities between K-pop males and females. Take beauty standards as an example. Fair skin is required for both men and female (other factors mainly focus on particular gender characteristics, e.g. small lovely noses for women). Men also show flawless skin, and the regimen is shared equally between the two genders. Salons and beauty clinics are now greeting customers from different genders while offering treatments that personify the same beauty standard. In this way, is it the males that are imitating the females? South Korea has a limited culture interaction range due to the small geographical area. More seriously, a lack of diversity is conspicuous—in 2020 only 4.9% of South Korean total population are foreigners. In a children chorus composed of local kids only, boys and girls are always uniform in make-ups—cherry lips, peachy cheeks, etc. First of all, facial features are in a likeness. Additionally, the makeup is the same. Would people consider the boys as feminine? Most likely no. As aforementioned, it is the cosmetics and also plastic surgeries apparently that are now popular in South Korea, rather than femininity. With the oneness in both aesthetics and races, undoubtfully the “male trend towards femininity” is proved to be absurd once again.</p>
<p>Remember: read through the definition carefully, and then be aware of the particularity of South Korean culture and everyone’s freedom in choosing how they look. At the end of the day, the discriminators are just defining K-pop males by appearance instinctively which is <strong>not restricted by gender</strong>. People can totally be opposed to “soft masculinity”, but they cannot change the phrase into “feminine complexions” since that means that they fail the equality between men and women.</p>

        <p>List of characters:</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> A sly guy who plays a trick on Red Riding Hood in order to kill she and her grandma for food.</p>
<p><strong>WOODCUTTER.</strong> A gallant and righteous men who save RRD and grandma from the wolf.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—The forest:</strong></p>
<p><em>(setting: a thriving forest where the crystal blue sky and sunshine vanish. The air is moggy. The ground is covered with fallen dark green leaves. Despite a faint scent, the stench is still conspicuous if you get a sensitive nose. Some rotting dead bodies are lying behind the oak roots.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silently but notably, a wolf with hostile and sly eyes lets his head out behind the oak, watching Red Riding Hood bouncing cheerfully towards north)</em></p>
<p><strong>RED RIDING HOOD (RRH).</strong> How nice the flowers smell! (<em>Pause.</em>) Something also smells odd in the air…maybe just my illusion (<em>grin.</em>) After all mom’s rotten eggs are so smelly!</p>
<p>​    (<em>the wolf steps out.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> (<em>smirk.</em>) Hello! My dear! Such a nice day, uh? </p>
<p><strong>RRH.</strong> (<em>startled.</em>) Oh, it’s you, Mr. Wolf? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> Ha, free Sunday, nothing to do! What about you dear? Where are you heading for wearing such a cute hood? (<em>wink.</em>) I can get you accompanied…you know…in such a dangerous forest.</p>
<p>​    (<em>RRD tends to nod, but hesitate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(to the audience, whisper.)</em> My mom told me to be ignorant to the stranger.</p>
<p>​    <em>（**wolf seems to have the ability of telepathy.**）</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(put his arm around RRD’s shoulder.)</em> I know your concern dear. It’s really unsafe for you to walk in the dark forest with a stranger like me. Why not tell me your destination, and then I will figure out whether the main big road can lead you to it or not?</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(ponder, then nod.)</em> Sure, Mr. Wolf! <em>(suddenly joyful.)</em> So generous are you! Actually, I gonna visit my grandma who lives in a hut.</p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(smirk, then pretend to laugh happily.)</em> Lucky you! The main road can definitely lead you there! So don’t risk your life in here anymore hon, go now! Bless you and the dear madam!</p>
<p><strong>RRD.</strong> <em>(touched.)</em> Cannot be more thankful. I will bring your blessing to grandma! </p>
<p>​    <em>(RRD leaves cheerfully, disappearing in the forest soon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>WOLF.</strong> <em>(to the audience.)</em> You know, I’ve been hungry for such a long time.</p>
<p>​    <em>(wolf heads for the north as the speed of light.)</em></p>

        <p>Clearly there are some clashes between pro and con side. But I can tell that the it is con side that causes this situation due to your logical fallacies and vague comprehension towards nearly everything, generally five points:</p>
<p>\0. There are actually <strong>two ways</strong> of dealing with nuclear leak, which means that what we have all said about ocean pollution, the fisherman can be totally avoided.</p>
<p>\1.   Nuclear energy is not as dangerous as you said—and even safer than driving a car. So why don’t you just worry about whether you should allow FP to drive a car?</p>
<p>\2.   Nuclear power plants are not responsible for protecting native culture, since it is the cultural department in the government that should take in charge.</p>
<p>\3.   Shut down power plants will not save the natural resources. Without provided nuclear energy, FP would do continuous logging. And it is so beneficial to the environment!</p>
<p>\4.   Last but not least, you have mentioned what happened in Japan right? The accidents happened just because they did not inject cool water in time. So if you are not in a coastal place, how can you ensure you can offer cool water sustainably?</p>
<p><strong>So, thank you so much for mentioning “Japan”, and “ocean” for so many times, providing us with so great examples to prove our thesis statement. And in conclusion, with great advantage in sustainability, economy, and humanity industry, we believe that nuclear power plants have a bright future in remote near-sea area. Nuclear power has been a significant character of the contemporary energy source, so we should catch up with the trend and keep abreast with the society. Above all, we can fully prove that it is possible to construct nuclear power plants. So, we can win the debate based on our framework.</strong></p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The first day egg-drop project was assigned (April 25th) we had already started designing our final product by researching ideal materials, and eventually our brainstorms “gave birth to” 7 different ones. The first one we came up with was bubble wrap. Since “pod” was not allowed, we needed something to ensure egg’s safety. Bubble wrap was definitely a good choice because it was light, protectable, and provided egg with larger space. Then I supposed something that protected the egg most efficiently was definitely a hen. So, why not creating a fake hen…just an imagination! Hard to get it come true. Kristen also raised up with a creative idea—use soda and Mentos to form foam and gas that can send the egg safely to the ground. However, any on-the-ground equipment would not be permitted. What’s more, the irregular produced foam would intensify uncertainty—the egg was still likely to smash to the ground due to the foam’s changing shape. So, was there anything that can be both as <strong>soft</strong> as hen and meanwhile <strong>hard</strong> enough to heat the ground while surviving…? That would be the non-Newtonian fluid! When the force acting on it, it acts like solid. Through systematic research, we have learnt that it can also be called Oobleck which carries itself as a liquid when being hold still so that “flexible egg shell” would be provided. After sharing all the ideas, we asked help from the internet. There’s a popular method—a triangle brace made by straws which fixed the egg in the center. But that would probably be a “pod” or the egg would fall off. Some foreigners also used a barrel of popcorns to prevent their baby eggs from breaking apart, but popcorns may disappoint the mass requirement. And the non-Newtonian fluid may miss the “most spectacular” shoot…just a bonus anyway. This method was practical (flour + water), and also catered to all our desires. And undeniably it was creative—we did not get this idea from the internet—all came after analysis, assumption, and our common sense.</p>
<p>To carry on our expectation on non-Newtonian fluid, we decided to put it into action. We made DIY non-Newtonian fluid—the mixture of certain amount of flour (45 grams) and water (50mL). I poured flour into a square-shaped bottle, and then the water was splashed in to form the fluid, the process of which was boosted by the use of stirring rod. Finally, the egg was in, swallowed and wrapped up (the container was sealed with plastic wrap and some tape). Mom dropped the container at 4th floor. The egg survived perfectly (although with slight damage to the container). Unfortunately, the total weight was about 165 grams! Soon we found out that nearly half of the bottle’s volume was unused so that wasted. Therefore, we changed it into a long neck bottle which required less fluid around the egg, and the bottle was cut down by its “waist”, helping the egg drop in more easily. The weight was controlled around 100 grams. Before the drop day we’ve done about ten times of practice. Besides the aforementioned trials, we were still trying to provoke innovation based on the uncertain mass. We decided to “take a risk”. Use softer plastic bottle. Considering the possibility of the container falling with its “mouth” down, we also added foam net into the space between the fluid and plastic wrap.That was a frustrating night. Our container fell onto the ceiling of the elevator twice without hitting the ground…and for every time we had to make another bottle of Oobleck! Finally we even risked our lives (exaggerated), pulling ourselves half out in the air and the ground eventually greeted her baby eggs (tried another two times to ensure final success)! And the result was absolutely the same—unbroken!</p>
<p>Here came to the Egg Drop Day! We prepared the Oobleck at noon and the total container weighed 98.4 grams. Arriving at 3rd floor, the egg was dropped but surprisingly smashed into “mango yogurt” thanks to the presence of Oobleck…We both were really depressed since it was the first time that the non-Newtonian fluid failed us! However, later on, I found out the possible reason: we were nervous before the activity so wrapping the container with several layers of plastic wrap! And that actually smoothened original edges while made the container more like a ball…the “ball” rolled so the egg lost the protection of Oobleck pathetically (between the top of the container and the egg, there was no Oobleck, only foam net). To prove our suggestion, we experimented two more times after school. This time we used less tape and the plastic wrap was only around the top of container. And, we did it! The egg was actually dropped from the 3.5th floor, and for both times it survived. Correct guess! However, we were also taken 1 point away for offering a “pod”, since we did not read the instructions carefully which clarified that “jelly” would not be permitted. No matter how we believed that to come up with this idea was already very innovated. Next time just read through the whole instruction page more slowly…and anything else was great! The process matters much more than the result.</p>

        <p>It depends. People from distinct religions and regions are supporting heterogeneous beauty standards. The same fact is—people are always chasing for beauty, because nearly everyone wants to have a not-so-bad look. And that is normal, very common based on human nature. So, if we only consider the perfect beauty standards, the health and beauty industry are safe, since these represent people’s nature of admiring beauty and their ideal figures. However, what we are concerning now is the methods used to approach these standards. Friends around me would instinctively laugh at my relevantly darker skin, frequently going on diets, and even plan carefully for a future plastic surgery. I’ve always been confused. Instinctively I cannot help but disapproving their manners. But why? I mean—everyone has their rights to chase for beauty, so is this also their right to take any extreme ways to achieve their goals? Maybe it is. So why am I denying their legitimate decisions? Perhaps it is due to my instinct to stick up for “natural beauty”. I even get uncomfortable when seeing my friends infatuated with make-ups. I’ve reflected on myself for so many times. Don’t be so extreme! Don’t be so harsh on your friends if yourself do not like it! You have to understand it is others’ right! Besides, even myself once planned to purchase a bunch of Dior or Channel’s cosmetics when growing into an adolescent. Literally, I enjoyed considering about that kind of thing! That made me feel confident, as if my life was extremely colorful. I can only tell that like me, preferring nature can refer to less care in personal appearance (well I still make sure that I’m in a tidy and easeful look). It is really hard for me to answer whether striving to be pretty by using whatever possible methods is correct and rational. I can only say that there is sequential safe level for health and beauty industry. The more thoughts you put on this field, the more “risks” you are likely to take since you’ve put too much precious energy on superficial fantasy. Deep down, infinite emptiness is out of ignorance because you are not living for yourself anymore but your appearance.</p>
