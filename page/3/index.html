        <p>u How does the author keep you in suspense in the first page of this chapter?</p>
<p>Connor wakes up in a medically induced coma, unconscious for two weeks which seems like eternity. His body is wound with bandage and the ache from whole body still doesn’t go away. However, everyone should know that Connor is the key Unwind, he couldn’t be released. Therefore, the nurse who comes to look after him might still someone working for Happy Jack Harvest Camp… Connor and Risa may still under the control of harvest camp and can get unwound later. The whole explosive actions happened before would worth nothing…like a big joke.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is ironic that Connor received the particular transplant that he did?</p>
<p>It seems quite ironic because Connor is the one who said “I would rather die than receive a piece of Unwind” before and he tried to run away from the destiny of getting unwound desperately. But now, he received a eye and an arm during his unconsciousness— he got something he never wants…he got something that comes from the procedure he ever wants to escape from. It must be astonishing and scary for Connor to accept. Yeah, it may seem ironic to Connor himself, but it was not his <strong>choice.</strong> Actually, this scene changes my attitude towards unwinding quite a lot. You see, Connor is always the one I appreciate, consistently fighting against unwinding, fighting for human rights. But when he is in then danger of dying, our superhero also needs organisms to survive, to fight back again. I think that’s why New York Times gave an approving review, claiming that “the power of the novel lies in what it doesn’t do: come down explicitly on one side or the other.” Now I wouldn’t be so outright like before emphasizing that unwinding is totally an unethical thing to do. I would be more open-minded. Maybe there are no right or wrong for the compromise between pro-life side and pro-choice side. God throws this tuff question to the world, just in aims of awaking us from blindness and staying open-minded. Fight for what you love, and accept the rest. Just as Nurse Greta said, <strong>“Love the ones you can, pray for the rest.”</strong></p>
<p>u What does Risa think Connor has changed into (end of chapter)?</p>
<p>Risa thinks Connor has changed into a man from a boy. It isn’t Connor’s age makes him man— it is how much he has grown up. The sense of naïve and impulsive have faded away. Connor’s soul was tamed by his impulsiveness. However, after having gone through so many difficulties, his soul begins to tam any other threats.</p>
<p>u Why does Lev’s lawyer talk to him about ‘insanity like it’s a good thing’?</p>
<p>Because from the lawyer’s point of view, he or she needs to stand by the side of Lev and to protect his life from unwinding. Insanity for becoming a clapper actually saves Lev’s life due to the chemicals in his blood. Therefore, “insanity like it” is a good thing for Lev which get him out of unwinding destiny.</p>
<p>u Do you think it is fitting that Connor has taken over the Graveyard?</p>
<p>Connor is probably the most suitable leader of Graveyard.</p>
<p>\1.  He owns a good reputation and authority— from the “rumor” of Akron Unwind to what happens at Happy Jack Harvest Camp, the Unwinds respect and believe in him.</p>
<p>\2.  He owns excellent leadership. Connor unites all the Unwinds in Graveyard to contribute to what they are fighting for.</p>
<p>\3.  Connor can now handle this responsibility. The courage of risking for life remains while the impulsiveness for acting without thinking vanishes.</p>
<p>\4.  Connor’s previous experiences are closely related to this place. He knows it well.</p>
<p>u Is the final message of the novel a positive one? Why?</p>
<p>It is a positive one, at least for Connor. Someone he loves, good friends, and all the kids facing the Unwind Order are all with him. Connor knows that now he doesn’t need to fight alone anymore. More importantly, he can see hope despite the threat of being exposed, which offers courage for all the Unwinds to live on.  </p>

        <p>UTA HAGEN</p>
<p>Questions for Character Study</p>
<ol>
<li> Who am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a teenage girl who is typically plain. When facing others’ teases, I stay humble and melancholy but still carefully tries to be myself— to do what other girls may do to make myself pretty.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Where am I?</li>
</ol>
<p>By the registration desk for the Galaxy Girl Pageant with chairs nearby.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> What surrounds me?</li>
</ol>
<p>The registration desk, the registration paper, a pen, Tara, a bunch of chairs</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> What time is it?</li>
</ol>
<p>School time.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What are my circumstances?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register for the Galaxy Girl Pageant… I don’t know whether I’m overconfident or blind… (when I put on those heels at home, I felt <strong>a little bit exhilarated</strong>— I’m acting like a princess! It wouldn’t be too bad compared with other girls…) Although still timid and humble, I light up my courage, pretending to be perky, to say “yes” and register. However, Tara points out my white feather deep down and sharply. In great sadness, Tara keeps convincing me to drop out… but I believe I can stand any of the teases and insults. Maybe just <strong>I believe</strong>… I haven’t given up yet thanks to plenty of practices done which makes me feel invincible. So weird Tara is! Her confusing actions provoke my hidden sense of inferiority— yeah, the pretties are with the pretties and I’m do hurt by what Selene said. All the trials out of the comfort zone, like registering the pageant, is aiming to get myself out of the labels— “plain”, “boring”, “not worthy hanging out with”. I’m not giving up. I want to prove that people like Selene are wrong. But Tara’s passionate comfort pulls me out of the hidden fury and bigoted decisions. She makes her sacrifice outrightly, and eventually we come close to each other.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li> What are my relationships?</li>
</ol>
<p>Tara is my best friend and I found Selene distant who makes me feel humble and worthless.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li> What do I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to register the Galaxy Girl Pageant to show that I’m also pretty compared with anyone else.</p>
<p>More importantly, deep down I want to rebuttal the people who define me as “boring” and “plain”.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li> What is my obstacle?</li>
</ol>
<p>\1.   Tara teases me for my plain appearance</p>
<p>\2.   The sense of inferiority due to other people e.g. Selene’s judgement.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li> What do I do to get what I want?</li>
</ol>
<p>I light up my courage to get out of my comfort zone. Register the Pageant and practice wearing heels a lot… what I am doing is aiming to be myself rather than remaining intimidated by the insults.</p>

        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile. However, Risa and Connor seem to come from two planets more often than not— “isolation” and “separateness” are conspicuous. So, is it only their common goal of staying alive that binds them? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Through thorough reading, it is not hard to register that the affection between Risa and Connor springs up owing to both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Risa and Connor’s “few” similarities is the perfect interpretation of the Admiral’s supreme rules—especially for “rise to the occasion”.</strong> The duo head for a bus stop tacitly at the instant when a police car appears, which indicates that they have been “molded” into coherent “underground workers” who keep “running will attract attention” in mind, and meanwhile flexible enough to utilize surroundings as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Comparatively, the couple’s escaping plan is also coolly probative. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing back cops, followed by rushing onto the interstate. Risa does the same except for the details— her destination is a forest and there’s no one blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In these cases, they are both holding wild intension towards surviving, so even though the chance comes in a hurry that could simultaneously wither away, they will succeed to grab it. Clearly, Risa and Connor are naturals in finding out the first priority, which makes them “excellent” AWOLs. This facilitates the first step of love—mutual appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>It is also very explicit to notice that the lovers have grown fearless.</strong> Back to the days at State Home, Risa shuddered when being order to “satisfy” budget cuts, almost involuntarily asking for other professions.

As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Having gone through so many life and death tests, now they take it easy. At least they have tried, leaving no regret. Risa and Connor stand the test of time so a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are truly ready for love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p><strong>Well, they own distinct characteristics.</strong> <strong>It is like a battle between ice and fire when referring to “rational versus emotional”.</strong> Connor constantly causes trouble as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Conversely his girlfriend is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland—even after the “Bathroom Event”. She is also sober enough to scan the danger of taking that new-born baby and then try her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like whether diverse emotions can be effectively controlled or not is the key difference between the couple, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, their characteristics gradually interweave afterwards— Risa begins to care about Connor instead of keeping distances, and Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t mean “identical”. The similarities between couples can only get them qualified and prepared for love. Tried-and-true love will appear only if both sides build a bridge over any existing gap, since that demonstrates great efforts for love, rather than illusion of romance. Between Risa and Connor love obtains the sublimation and the eternal.</p>

        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”.</strong> Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary.

As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>u Why are the questions Risa is being asked so disturbing?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>“You seem to be in good physical condition. You’ve been getting a lot of exercise, yes? Running, perhaps?”</strong></p>
<p>The staff here do care about the physical health of the Unwinds. However, through observation towards a basketball game, Risa realizes that the harvest camp is actually caring about their values, rather than they can lead a healthy life or not. She definitely feels offended because every Unwind here is priced as something waiting for sell, which is like the value evaluation of pork. And no one here cares about the Unwinds anymore.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>“Over the next few weeks you’ll be involved in a program of diverse activities. Risa, dear, are you listening? Is any of this going over your head— would you like me to slow down?”</strong></p>
<p>The harvest counselor defines any Unwind as an imbecile who needs someone talking to them to slow down to help them understand, even for some beyond average Unwind like Risa. Risa feels like the counselor holds ridiculous stereotypes towards Unwinds, which also makes her outraged.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>“Most of the questions don’t matter at this point… but if you have any specific skills you’d like to let us know about— you know, things that could be of use to the community during your stay here…”</strong></p>
<p>It is almost the same question that is always used to question an Unwind— “What good are you?” Risa feels like everyone is suggesting that an Unwind must be worthless. Once again, Risa experiences the indifference of the world.</p>
<p>  In conclusion, Risa feels the questions so disturbing due to the whole world’s misunderstanding and indifference to Unwinds.</p>
<p>u How does the camp’s daily routine make the Unwinds seem to be like?</p>
<p>Risa once imagined the harvest camp to be a human- cattle- stockades. Although Happy Jack Harvest Camp looks distinct to that imagination, Risa’s anticipation is actually true. The Unwinds are like a group of pigs, evaluated, and then wait for slaughter.</p>
<p>u Why are the tithes treated differently to everyone else?</p>
<p>They are not captured to come here— they are totally willing to go. People see them as a gift to the god, rather than someone causing trouble and offending the god. They treat tithes specially and carefully to “help” tithes complete their common destiny.</p>
<p>Also, the special treatment also seems like a sarcasm to the terribles, which are indicating that they do not deserve any special treatment.</p>
<p>u What does it tell you about the Unwinds state of mind that they would attempt to jump off a two-storey building in order to stave off Unwinding?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Actually, the Unwinds can be devastating.</strong> There is no other way to stave off unwinding. They can only choose to hurt themselves to win a chance of survival, which is quite lugubrious. Although they seem surprising towards this hopeful plan, the Unwinds must be sentimental. They may have gone a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>u How has Lev’s attitude towards tithing changed since the very start of the story?</p>
<p>In the beginning, Lev found being a tithe honorable and condescending, but also a little bit confused as he would feel intimidated by the prospect from time to time, almost involuntarily. That scared feeling comes from his nature, which is much weaker than the result of being brainwashed. Yet after the School Event, Lev became totally confused with his identity. The only thing that he was sure about is that Lev ought to re-recognize himself. After getting along with CyFi, Lev burnt the fire of hatred towards the people who signed the Unwind Order.  Lev must have recalled his own family when seeing CyTy with his parents. The reason he got so furious is probably because what happened in front of him reminds him that his own parents were also so indifferent when sending him to get unwound. That’s why Lev totally changed his attitude towards tithing. Lev’s recognition of human nature finally dominates his mind. When Lev makes up his mind to join the clappers, he’s heart is filled with fury and hatred towards this identity, this world. The identity of tithes only means a good cover for him to release dissatisfaction towards the world. </p>
<p>u What is ironic about Roland finally being ‘worth more than any other kid’ in his unit? Why is Roland being denied a priest?</p>
<p>\1.  Roland is unwound like all the other terribles. No one cares whether Roland is dominant or worthy among all the Unwinds. He ends up like all other Unwinds: into the unconsciousness forever.</p>
<p>\2.  No one except tithes are permitted to be accompanied by a priest, and Roland is the same as all the Unwinds to the surgeons, which means that he has no right to require a priest.</p>
<p>\3.  Roland owns a valuable blood type, which makes him “worthy”. However, due to his “value”, he is ordered to get unwound sooner than any other Unwinds.</p>
<p>\4.  Because priest is for people who are dying. However, the surgeon thinks that being unwound is absolutely not dying— Roland would still stay alive, just in a different way.</p>
<p>u Why do they keep the unwinds alive during the unwinding process?</p>
<p>Because it is regulated by the law that the Unwinds must be conscious about what is going on on them during the whole procedure. Maybe by this way, someone who carry on the Unwinds Order would be less guilty— after all the Unwinds default what they are doing.</p>
<p>u How is the tree a metaphor for the Unwinds?</p>
<p>\1.  The original tree is grafted with numerous limbs that makes it show a multitude of distinct flowers. This refers to how the Unwinds “function”. They are just like the distinct flowers on the same tree— the same recipient. However, here the pastor are showing how useful the tithes are, which can reflectively shows that it is the Unwinds that makes a recipient colorful and lively.</p>
<p>u Do you think the way Connor faces his unwinding is brave? Or do you think he has given up?</p>
<p>I think he is definitely very brave rather than having given up. If Connor has gives up, he won’t get rid of the guards’ hands and walk on his own. In the beginning, Connor’s mind messes up which is full of the desire of being alive. But then he makes up his mind to use all rest of time appreciating <strong>who he is.</strong> so Connor, positively, walks forward and appreciates as many views as he can.</p>
<p>u What is ironic about Lev’s final destructive actions in the end?</p>
<p>\1.  Although Lev has changed a lot— become crueler, indifferent. However, that is actually a cover that protects his real nature— I want to stay alive. Actually, as a clapper, he is brainwashed again, which is hidden clue in the plot. This time, he does not choose to obey someone that brainwashes him. Instead, he chooses to fight for what is truly in his heart. The irony can be Lev’s parents’ brainwash, because this time Lev is not affected by surroundings. It can also be ionic for the other clappers since there’s someone finally not so crazy and blind as any other of them.</p>

        <p>Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, argues that “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, a lovely pair emerges— Risa and Connor. Their life traces overlap once the Unwind Orders are signed: they both go into exile. However, they seem to come from two planets more often than not— “isolation” and “separateness” are conspicuous. So, is it only their common goal of staying alive that binds them? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? <strong>Through reading *Unwind*, it is not hard to register that the affection between Risa and Connor springs up owing to both their similarities and differences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Risa and Connor’s “few” similarities is the perfect interpretation towards the Admiral’s supreme rules—especially for “rise to the occasion”.</strong> The duo head for the bus stop tacitly at the instant when a police car appears, which indicates that they have been molded into coherent “fighting” forces that keep “running will attract attention” in mind, and meanwhile flexible enough to utilize surroundings as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Comparatively, the couple’s escaping plan is also coolly probative. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing back cops, followed by rushing onto the interstate while Risa is the same except the details that her destination is a forest and there’s no one blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In these cases, they are holding wild intension towards surviving, so when the chance comes in a hurry that could simultaneously wither away, they succeed to grab it. Clearly, Risa and Connor are naturals in finding out the first priority, which makes them excellent AWOLs. This facilitates the first step of love—mutual appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>It is also very explicit to notice that the lovers both have grown fearless, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding.</strong> Risa shuddered when being order to “satisfy” budget cuts, almost involuntarily asking for other professions. Moreover, she was ashamed for current identity so hid and made it up on the transition bus. Similarly, Connor needed Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind”. Connor and Risa were too intimidated by the prospect compared with what happens on them later: in Happy Jack Harvest Camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor ultimately walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Having gone through a bunch of life and death tests, now they take it easy. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are ready for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p><strong>Well, they own distinct characteristics.</strong> <strong>It is like a battle between ice and fire when referring to “rational versus emotional”.</strong> Connor constantly causes trouble as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Conversely Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland—even after the “Bathroom Event”. She is also sober enough to scan the danger of taking that new-born baby and then try her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like whether their diverse emotions can be effectively controlled or not is the couple’s key difference and therefore their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins to care about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t mean “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them prepared and qualified for love. Tried-and-true love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over any existing gap, since that demonstrates great efforts for love, rather than illusion of romance. Between Risa and Connor love obtained the sublimation and the eternal.</p>

        <p>According to Erich Fromm, a German social psychologist, “love makes men overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits to be himself, to remain his integrity.” In the dystopian novel <em>Unwind</em>, we can see a lovely pair ultimately— Risa and Connor. Their life trace overlaps once the Unwind Orders for them are signed, so coincidently both are on exile.  However, they seem to come from two planet from time to time— “isolation” and “separateness” are common. So, is it their two or three similarities that connect them together? Are Planet Connor and Planet Risa connected? Risa and Connor’s love actually depends on both their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>First one of Risa and Connor’s “two or three similarities”, is the perfect interpretation of one piece of the Admiral’s supreme rule— “rise to the occasion” and “make something of yourself”. Both of them are heading for bus stop tacitly in the instant when a police car appears. Clearly, “running will attract attention”, and they are both intelligent and flexible to utilize something in front of us as a cover— high-school-aged kids. Also, it is very interesting to notice the two’s escape plan reflect this point. Connor makes a split-second decision of pushing away cops, rushing onto the interstate while Risa does the same thing except the fact that her destination is a forest and actually there’s no one is blocking her due to the car accident caused by Connor. In this case, they are holding wild intension towards being alive, so when opportunity comes or nearly withers away, they succeed to deliver. The two qualities make them excellent AWOLs, which is the first step of mutual appreciation, and love.</p>
<p>It is also very explicit to notice that these lovers have both grown up a lot, which can be epitomized by the changing attitude towards unwinding. Risa’s mind messes up when being ordered to be unwound, panic and distracted applying for other professions. She is also ashamed for the identity so hide and make it up on the transition bus. Meanwhile Connor needs Ariana to light up his courage to face Unwind Order, and “would rather die than get a piece of an Unwind. Clearly, they were too emotional towards this order compared with what happens to them later: in the harvest camp, Risa becomes a pianist while Connor walks into the unwinding room safe and sound. Now they take it easy, which indicates that they have grown fearless. As the old saying goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Risa and Connor stand the test of time and a solid bond is formed between each other. Now they are fully prepared for the love.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the differences, will the emerging love shatters?</p>
<p>Firstly, more people have unique relationship with Connor than Risa. He hung out with Ariana, and own a complete family consist of parents, brother, and previous sweet memories although burning into ashes now. Conversely, Risa grows up in State Home and there’s no one mentioned in the novel that maintain a lasting impact on her when in exile. All in all, loads of cared people bring Connor the double amounts of diverse emotions which dominate his judgement. In comparison, less emotional relationship demonstrates independence, tenacity, and fewer possibilities of being affected by surroundings. In this way, individual personality traits are gradually forming…</p>
<p>However, Risa and Connor actually own conspicuously distinct characteristics. It is like the battle between ice and fire when it comes to “rational versus emotional”. Connor frequently cause trouble, as getting into a bunch of fights at school, and adding a “troublesome” new-born to their exile. Risa is able to put her hatred aside while remaining observant towards Roland. She is also sober enough to realize the danger of taking that new-born baby and does her best to “wake” Connor up. It seems like the gap between them is whether their emotion can be controlled effectively, and their personality traits are just complementary. Nevertheless, later on their characteristics gradually interweave— Risa begins caring about Connor instead of keeping distances while Connor can amazingly control his fury. As they comprehending and then coming close to each other, yet still “remain integrity”, the seed of love sprouts. </p>
<p>Love doesn’t refer to “identical”. The similarities between lovers can only get them ready for love, since they only mean that the lovers have the qualifications for love. True love emerges only if both sides build a bridge over existing gap.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Head, Face, &amp; Neck</p>
<p>l <strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>I can exactly use the depiction from the original to describe Scarlett in the movie— “The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.” Scarlett has got a pair of eyes for story-telling, and has so much life that she rolls eyeballs frequently and her eyebrows are always dancing. The pursing of lips and exuded “grievance” in face both prove Scarlett a “skilled flirt”. Generally, Scarlett always wears exaggerated, lovely, and piteous expressions which fills men with protectiveness towards her.</p>
<p>l <strong>Make and appreciate eye contact.</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett is often over-confident and remains ambivalent towards men. The reason Scarlett is so attractive to them is that her lovely green eyes can took men’s soul which is like a hook attaching to their heart. Imagine such a charming girl are gazing at you while offering an arresting grin.</p>
<p>l <strong>Tend to smile, but then smirk</strong></p>
<p>Before the break out of Civil War, Scarlett’s smile is naïve, genuine, and flirtatious. However, having gone through parents’ passing away and several bad-ending marriages, she is just like the flower flying in the wind, catering to the request of world and life. The facial is not as lively as before: the size of smile is gradually fixed.</p>
<p>Upper body: </p>
<p>l <strong>Upright posture, like a princess</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett always has her arms bent in front of body to lift dress with head lordly raised up, which is almost the same compared with the depiction from the original— “The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.”</p>
<p>l <strong>Active gestures &amp; touches</strong></p>
<p>When meeting men, Scarlett always offer her hands directly for a kiss and sometimes point at them saucily.</p>
<p>l <strong>Extremely shallow &amp; deep breaths</strong></p>
<p>Normally, Scarlett looks as if she is not breathing at all, which may benefit from the good education as a lady. However, it is also very apparent that stress or fear can also intensify her breaths greatly. In this case, Scarlett acts as if she will suffer a split-second faint.</p>
<p>Lower body:</p>
<p>l <strong>light on her feet</strong></p>
<p>As Melanie says, “Oh Scarlett, you have so much life.” Scarlett is light-footed like a little cat. However, she stumbles from the stairs later, which leads to a miscarriage.</p>
<p>l <strong>Quick and saucy movements</strong></p>
<p>Scarlett always acts as if she is in a rush to a ball. But later on, I realized that she gets a short temper which I associate with pepper.t</p>
<p>l <strong>Walk heel-first</strong></p>
<p>Although Scarlett is always releasing her charm intentionally, she seems full of confidence and her steps are full of strength. Clearly she is a remarkably adroit and determined woman.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Part FIVE:</strong></p>
<p>u Why has the author included the list of the Admiral’s rules in this chapter?</p>
<p>\1. <strong>Introduce ten supreme rules to help readers know more about the Admiral.</strong> The second and fourth demands clarifies— “SURVIVING HAS EARNED YOU THE RIGHT TO BE RESPECTED” “YOUR LIFE IS MY GIFT FOR YOU. TREAT IT LIKE ONE.”, which demonstrate his respect to the Unwinds and human nature and even makes him sound like a pro-life warrior in the previous war… Also, rule No. 3, No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8, reflects the Admiral’s traits of responsible and strict. He actually “governs” graveyard coherently.</p>
<p>\2. In the context, some of the demonstrated rules are combined with the depiction of Unwinds’ interpretation. So the separated rule construction can sometimes be a <strong>generalization of what’s exactly going on on the graveyard.</strong></p>
<p>\3. Clearly, the demonstration of rules gives a quick <strong>preview of the Connor and Risa’s current living model and offers an environment or structure for the happen of coming events.</strong> </p>
<p>u How has Shusterman made the Admiral seem mysterious? What do we find out later about that particular mystery?</p>
<p>\1. Firstly, <strong>the Admiral’s words</strong> make him seem mysterious. When Connor asks “Who are you, exactly?”, he clarifies nothing but his identity of a former admiral of the United States Navy. Also, from <strong>the Unwinds impression towards him</strong>. (a. In the book, the Unwinds register the Admiral’s motivation as secret as his name. All the new coming Unwinds are curious about their governor here.</p>
<p>(b. Risa recognizes the Admiral’s war uniform, but is confused about whether is came from the pro-life or pro-choice side. That would definitely make his seem mysterious because neither side won or came up with the idea of “unwind”. Also, the wild spread out of rumors towards the Admiral also adds to his mystery.</p>
<p>   \2. The Admiral’s perfect teeth same as the boy in the photo are actually dentures. And the boy is his own son rather than some Unwind from which the Admiral took teeth away. The reason those teeth look so similar is that the Admiral’s dentures record is utilized. However, there’s something true about the rumor: the boy is unwound thanks to the Admiral indeed.</p>
<p>u What does Risa say the Admiral has done for her? Why is this important to her?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Risa says that the Admiral has given her back her right to exist.</strong> The “legal” occupation he offers adds to Risa’s security and she gradually gets along with her new life.</p>
<p>\2.   (a. It helps Risa live <strong>happies and more relaxed</strong>. The Admiral gives her a shelter place and a promise for life. That finally get Risa start to enjoy and stop being concern about her life. The job also fills her day and mind, which turns her life meaningful and peace. After all, Risa don’t need to worry about the horrible result of behaving badly. Gradually she forms a more concentrated and peaceful mind that allows Risa to enjoy life implicitly. (b. Risa is also <strong>reassuring and find a sense of security</strong> as her right as an Unwind is finally be respected.</p>
<p>\3.   How does Connor react to Lev’s arrival? Why does he react this way?</p>
<p>\1. Simultaneously Connor gets exhilarated and runs towards Lev. And then become rational, calmer for his betrayal and surprised for Lev is still alive. He doesn’t come to Lev immediately because he wants to see how is he going on currently. After their eyes meet Connor gets close to Lev, however punching him in his eyes and then pulls Lev into his hug with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>\2. Connor is always burning hatred towards Lev for his betrayal which is Connor’s last memory involved Lev so it must be remembered clearly. So, when other mixed flood of feelings passes away, this conspicuous emotion would definitely show up. However, having gotten in touch with Unwinds of diverse stories, Connor becomes more open-minded and remains kind and emotional always, therefore he still holds an instinct of caring about Lev. After all, Connor once saved Lev. He definitely doesn’t want someone saved by him to gain death again. Connor is someone that can never act against his heart, for instance standing on the side of Roland. Deep down Connor knows that Lev gets good qualities which match his conscience.</p>
<p>\4.   Who are <em>the Goldens</em>? What has happened to them? What is their connection between Connor and the Admiral?</p>
<p>\1. The <em>Goldens</em> are made up of Amp, Jeeves, another two boys and a girl. They are the Admiral’s five most trusted kids and therefore in charge. They are the ears and eyes of the Admiral to keep him abreast of the state of things among the Unwinds.</p>
<p>\2.  They suffocated in the same crate as those five kids who died in the same way during transmit.</p>
<p>\3. For the Admiral, the Goldens’ death works as a great loss but also a tool. Now the Admiral chooses Connor who is completely righteous to be his new eyes and ears, which would help him find out the real culprits. For Connor, the horrible incident gradually forms and strengthens his trust towards the Admiral. Also, Connor has now clearly clarified which side he is on.</p>
<p>\5.   What is the group’s philosophy for doing what they mysteriously do? Do you think this is a good reason? What do we find out they did in part 5?</p>
<p>\1. The group of three believe in randomness and forces of nature. Their belief is to create chaos and mess with the world.</p>
<p>\2. I don’t think it is a good reason…as making chaos makes no sense to me. But I do think there’s something behind an excuse of just wanting to mess up everything. The group extremely hate those people getting benefit from the Unwinds, so the hatred may be transformed into the intension to make all people suffer.</p>
<p>\3. They mess with the Admiral secretly. They kill the Goldens by creating a same death place and method for them as the five kids suffocated in the crate.</p>
<p>\6.   How is Risa and Connor’s relationship developed further in this chapter?</p>
<p>\1. Risa figures out that there’s something wrong with Connor. She is not so cold and rational as before, trying to keep distance between herself and Connor. Now, she becomes the one taking the first step to care about another. And Connor is also concerned about Risa’s safety. Their relationship greatly and amazingly develops in their reciprocal care.</p>
<p>\7.   What do we find out about the Admiral in chapter 37?</p>
<p>\1. The Admiral’s last name is surprisingly “Dunfee”, which makes me shudder and recall the former description of Humphrey Dumfee. Moreover, he is trying to redeeming himself and Emby is exactly a vital portion for making up the mistake of unwinding his son.</p>
<p>\8.   What interaction happens between Connor and Roland beginning in chapter 40? What is the result of this interaction by the end of part 5?</p>
<p>\1. Connor entices Roland into the FedEx jet, and then pushes him into Crate 2933 in violence in order to make it possible and safe for a conversation about the death of the Goldens.</p>
<p>\2. The interaction intensifies Roland’s hatred and fury against Connor, so he turns Risa and Connor in. However, the Juvey-cops also finds Roland guilty for association and all of them are taken to the harvest camp to get unwound.</p>
<p>\9.   What gives the mob its power? Why are the chapters leading up to the climax so short? Why does the author alternate between the mob and the other characters?</p>
<p>\1. The mobs’ ignorance gives them power. They trust rumors easily. Every horrible story comes true in their mouth so their fury can never be controlled.</p>
<p>\2. I think the short transition demonstrates how powerful rumors and the crowd are. It may only take the furious and blind people a few seconds to get to the climax of hurting someone physically beyond control. Meanwhile, it is also a great way to show how resentful the mobs are.</p>
<p>\3. I think the alternation between the mobs and other characters are quite profound, because “the other characters” here refers to Connor, Risa, Hayden, Roland, and the Admiral. Clearly, they are the main characters that the author is dedicated to talk about. The alternation actually forms a contraction which implies that these main characters are unique and influence the going of plot a lot. We can generally describe that the mobs are all doing the same thing—physical attack. But what these main characters are doing must be totally different, outstanding, and profound.</p>
<p>\10. Why is Connor’s quote ‘you should all be unwound’ so shocking? (pg. 193) Do you agree with him?</p>
<p>\1. Because Connor is always a righteous and kind figure for all of the Unwinds. The other Unwinds trust him and rely on him, so they believe that they have the same level of hatred to the Unwind order. Moreover, right there is the graveyard where they get protection from the Unwind order. Connor’s shocking words are definitely opposite from the graveyard’s purpose. More importantly, every Unwind feels grieved and uncertain about the fact that they are defined worthless. Connor’s words prove the credibility of their concerns to some extent so they are totally shocked.</p>
<p>\2. I partially agree with him. Of course, Connor doesn’t mean that but he is numbed with fury. Imagine, you see a bunch of people trying torturing someone you respect and appreciate, how would you react? And there is also something true about Connors’ words. It is the Admiral that covers the mobs from getting unwound. Without him, all of them would get that they supposed to suffer from. So, it is rational that the mobs would be unwound if they get rid of the Admiral. </p>
<p>\11. Why is Roland’s plan of turning in the whole camp of Unwinds quite futile? Why can’t Roland see that?</p>
<p>\1. The succeed of Roland’s plan based on whether the information he offered can surprise the cops so that Risa and Connor can be caught successfully as a reward to himself. However, the cops already know the existence of the graveyard and what the Admiral is doing against the law. They are just too lazy and irresponsible to round them up. In this way, the cops are not eager at all to capture all the Unwinds in Graveyard.</p>
<p>\2. Roland can only see his intension to make others suffer. He becomes blind owing to hatred and the desire for power, which blocks his observation, consideration and carefulness.</p>
